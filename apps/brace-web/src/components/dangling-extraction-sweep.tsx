// Once-per-session trigger for the dangling-extraction janitor
// (sweepDanglingExtractions — see its header for what a dangling is and why it's
// fixed by deletion). Renders nothing; it just watches for the session's first
// COMPLETED sync cycle and fires the sweep once.
//
// It lives in brace-web — not in a shared web-react provider — on purpose: the sweep
// queues REMOTE deletes from "link absent locally", which is only sound on a client
// that syncs the whole library. brace-web is one; the browser extension is not — it
// syncs selectively (a `pathFilter` in its sync-runner, today skipping `pins/`), and
// which prefixes it materializes is its own call to change. So the sweep must never
// be inherited by mounting a shared provider: that would couple these remote deletes
// to whatever some other app's filter happens to be.
//
// The guard (`storeStatus === 'ready' && bgSyncStatus === 'idle' && lastSyncAt !==
// null`) means "a cycle finished successfully this session": lastSyncAt is null until
// a cycle completes, and after a failure bgSyncStatus is 'error', so the pair can't
// be satisfied by the initial state or a failed cycle. That timing matters — during
// the initial pull (and before any pull), "link absent" proves nothing (see the sweep's
// header). Once per session is enough: danglings are rare, one skews a stat, and the
// component remounts on the next sign-in/visit ((app) layout) so garbage never
// outlives a session boundary by more than a session.
