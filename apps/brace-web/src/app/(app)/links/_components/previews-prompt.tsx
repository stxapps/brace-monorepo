// The links page's first-run offer for link previews — brace-web's counterpart to
// brace-expo's `features/links/previews-prompt.tsx`, and deliberately NOT a port of it
// (docs/link-extraction.md — _the links-page offer_). Same shape, same one-time
// device-local dismissal, same "ask at the first moment it means something" rationale:
// it shows only when links are actually waiting for a preview, so a fresh account with
// nothing saved gets no banner and neither does a fully-previewed library.
//
// What differs is the ASK, because on web the thing being offered isn't free:
//
//   - **Plus/Pro** — the offer is the synced `serverExtraction` opt-in, which admits a
//     new party (`brace-extractor`) to the URLs it fetches. That is heavier consent
//     than expo's on-device fetch, so this banner does NOT flip it: the button links to
//     Settings → Link previews, where the toggle sits next to the copy that names the
//     service and next to "Generate all" (the confirm-gated job that actually drains
//     the backlog this banner is counting). A one-tap "turn on" here would both thin
//     the consent and under-deliver — enabling the opt-in alone only starts the
//     displayed-scoped auto drain, so the N in the headline would barely move.
//   - **free** — `serverExtraction` is a Plus entitlement (shared `entitlementsOf`), so
//     the honest offer is the browser extension: free, local, and the best extractor
//     there is (active-tab DOM — see _capability tiers_). It previews links as you save
//     them rather than back-filling these, which the copy says plainly instead of
//     implying an install clears the count; the back-fill is what Plus adds, linked
//     second and stated once, not sold. It links straight to /settings/subscription
//     rather than calling `usePaywall()`: the paywall dialog is the ACTION-INTERRUPT
//     pattern (a free user clicked a gated affordance), and nothing was clicked here
//     — this is the inline "See plans" surface the paywall provider's header points
//     such cases at, the same door LockedBanner (search-bar.tsx) uses.
//
// The count comes from `readRawPendingTitleImageCount` (four index counts, no decode,
// no trash-correction join), not `useExtractionCounts`: the exact tally is gated on
// extraction being ENABLED, which is precisely what this banner exists to ask about.
// Raw pending is a strict over-count, the right side to err on for a "you have links
// without previews" prompt — and the read runs ONLY while the banner could show, so it
// costs nothing in steady state. Pass-through-returned into `useLiveQuery` (no stacked
// await) so Dexie's dependency tracking survives — see readLinks' zone-echo note.
