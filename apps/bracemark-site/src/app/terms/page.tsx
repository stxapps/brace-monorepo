};

// Both Apple and Google require a reachable terms URL on the listing, and the
// listings are what lock the bundle ID in (docs/brand.md) — so this route has to
// carry real content before submission, not a placeholder.
//
// Adapted from the terms the same company published for Brace.to, with three
// substantive changes, all forced by what Bracemark actually is:
//   - The account section is rewritten end to end. The old one described a Stacks
//     account, a Secret Key and a Gaia data server; this one describes the
//     password-derived key and the recovery door (docs/account.md), and states
//     plainly that a lost password with no recovery code is unrecoverable.
//   - An acceptable-use section was added. The old terms had none, and store
//     reviewers look for one.
//   - The subscription section covers Paddle and both app stores, matching the
//     three purchase paths in docs/iap.md.
//
// NOT LEGAL ADVICE, and this file is not a substitute for review by a Thai
// lawyer — particularly the dispute-resolution and consumer-rights sections,
// which interact with local law and with the EU/UK statutory withdrawal right the
// business model already assumes (docs/business-model.md, _pricing_). The company
// name and postal address come from `COMPANY` in lib/site.ts; verify the address
// before publishing.
//
// The markup is plain h2/h3/p/ol under `.legal-prose` (globals.css) on purpose:
// this document gets edited under time pressure while answering a reviewer, and
// it has to stay readable as prose rather than as a wall of class names.

        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Bracemark website at
          bracemark.com and app.bracemark.com, the Bracemark applications for iOS, Android, Chrome
          and Firefox, and any related services (together, the “Service”), all provided by {company}{' '}
          (“{COMPANY.shortName}”, “we”, “us”).
        </p>
        <p>
          By creating an account, or by otherwise accessing or using the Service, you agree to be
          bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to them, please stop using the Service and
          uninstall the applications. Our <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> explains how
          we handle information and forms part of this agreement.
        </p>

        <h2>Who may use the Service</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service, and old enough to form a binding
          contract where you live. If you use the Service on behalf of an organisation, you confirm
          that you are authorised to accept these Terms for it.
        </p>

        <h2>Your licence to use the Service</h2>
        <p>
          Subject to your compliance with these Terms, {COMPANY.shortName} grants you a limited,
          non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable licence to use the
          Service, and to install and use the applications on devices you own or control, for your
          own personal or internal business use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your licence to any application you download from an app store is also governed by that
          store’s own terms (the “App Store Terms”). Where these Terms conflict with the applicable
          App Store Terms, the App Store Terms prevail for that application. Download the
          applications only from the stores through which we publish them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your licence, or any part of the Service, if you breach these
          Terms or the acceptable-use rules below. On termination, the rights granted to you end and
          you must stop using the Service; the sections that by their nature should survive —
          including those covering our content, disclaimers, liability, indemnity and disputes —
          continue to apply.
        </p>

        <h2>Your account, your password and your key</h2>
        <p>
          A Bracemark account is a username and a password. We do not ask for an email address or
          any other personal identifier, and there is no account-verification step.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your password derives the key that encrypts your data.</strong> That derivation
          happens on your device. Neither your password nor the key it produces is ever sent to us,
          and we have no copy of either. This has consequences you must accept before you use the
          Service:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>We cannot reset your password and we cannot recover your data.</strong> If you
            lose your password and have not saved a recovery code, your saved links cannot be
            decrypted by anyone — including us. This is not a support matter that can be escalated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A recovery code is your second way in.</strong> The Service can generate one
            when you create your account, and you can generate or replace one later. It is shown
            once. Storing it somewhere safe, and separately from your password, is your
            responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anyone with your password or recovery code has your library.</strong> You are
            responsible for keeping both secret and for all activity under your account, whether or
            not you authorised it. Tell us promptly if you believe either has been exposed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Usernames are unique and, once an account is deleted, the username is retired rather than
          released for reuse. Some usernames are reserved so that no account can appear to speak for
          Bracemark or for a system role.
        </p>

        <h2>Your content</h2>
        <p>
          The links you save, and everything you record about them, remain yours. You grant us no
          licence over their contents, and we could not exercise one if you did: we hold them only
          as encrypted files that we have no means of reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for what you save and for having the right to save it. Because the
          Service stores addresses and your own notes rather than copies of third-party pages, you
          should assume that a saved link is a pointer, not an archive, and that the page it points
          to may change or disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Export your data at any time, on any plan, using the export feature in the app. We
          recommend keeping your own backups: our storage is redundant, but it is not a substitute
          for a copy you control.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have not signed in or used your account for at least two years, we reserve the
          right to delete the data stored for it, in order not to hold encrypted data indefinitely
          for accounts that have been abandoned.
        </p>

        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            use the Service to store or distribute material that is unlawful where you are, or that
            infringes someone else’s rights;
          </li>
          <li>
            attempt to gain unauthorised access to any account, system or data, or to circumvent any
            limit, quota or entitlement in the Service;
          </li>
          <li>
            interfere with the operation of the Service, including by automated request volumes that
            degrade it for others, or by using the link-extraction service to fetch pages at a scale
            or for a purpose it is not intended for;
          </li>
          <li>
            resell, sublicense or commercially redistribute the Service, or use it to build a
            competing product;
          </li>
          <li>
            reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble any part of the Service, except to the extent
            that applicable law expressly permits it despite this restriction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may rate-limit, suspend or terminate access that we reasonably believe breaches these
          rules or threatens the stability of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Plans, fees and subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          The Service has a free plan and one or more paid plans. The features and limits of each
          are described on our <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link>. We may change what the
          plans include; where a change would materially reduce what you have already paid for, it
          will not take effect until your current paid period ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices are stated in US dollars and may be presented to you in your local currency, with
          any applicable taxes calculated at checkout. Paid plans purchased on the web are sold
          through Paddle, which acts as the merchant of record for that sale; purchases made inside
          the iOS or Android applications are sold through Apple or Google under their terms. We
          never receive or store your payment card details.
        </p>
        <p>If you purchase a subscription or start a trial, the following apply:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Free trial.</strong> Where a trial is offered it lasts {TRIAL_DAYS} days and
            applies to the annual {PLAN_LABELS.plus} plan. Unless you cancel before it ends, it
            converts into a paid subscription and the first payment is taken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Auto-renewal.</strong> Subscriptions renew automatically for successive periods
            of the same length, at the then-current price plus any applicable taxes, until you
            cancel. Deleting your account does not cancel a subscription — cancel it through the
            provider you bought it from.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You may cancel at any time: through the Paddle customer
            portal for a web purchase, or through the App Store or Google Play for a purchase made
            in those apps. Access to paid features continues until the end of the period you have
            already paid for.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds for web purchases are handled by Paddle, and refunds
            for store purchases by Apple or Google, under their respective policies. If you are a
            consumer in the EU or the UK you may also have a statutory right to withdraw within
            fourteen days of the contract being formed. If something has gone wrong with a payment,
            write to us at {SUPPORT_EMAIL} and we will help.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If we stop offering a paid plan for reasons within our control, we will cancel affected
          subscriptions and refund the unused portion of any period already paid for. If payment
          fails, access to paid features may be suspended after a grace period; your data is never
          deleted for non-payment, and your library remains readable and exportable on the free
          plan.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to the Service</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify, suspend or discontinue any part of the Service. Where a change is
          significant and affects a paid plan, we will give reasonable notice through the app or
          this website.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may revise these Terms from time to time. The date at the top of this page shows when
          they last changed, and continuing to use the Service after a revision means you accept the
          revised Terms. Where a change is material we will make reasonable efforts to highlight it
          in the app.
        </p>

        <h2>Our content and trademarks</h2>
        <p>
          {COMPANY.shortName} and its licensors own the Service, the applications, and the software,
          designs and other materials that make them up, together with all associated intellectual
          property rights. The Service is licensed to you, not sold, and we reserve all rights not
          expressly granted in these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Bracemark”, the Bracemark logo, the Bracemark app icon and the Bracemark product screens
          are trademarks or otherwise the subject of intellectual property rights of{' '}
          {COMPANY.shortName}, and may not be used without our prior written permission. Other
          trademarks appearing in the Service belong to their respective owners, who may have no
          connection with us.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-party materials</h2>
        <p>
          The Service stores and displays links to websites and services that we do not control. We
          do not endorse them and we are not responsible for their content, their terms or their
          privacy practices, and we are not liable for any loss arising from your use of or reliance
          on them.
        </p>

        <h2>System requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Using the Service requires a compatible device, internet access, and up-to-date software,
          any of which may carry their own costs. Because the Service is local-first, it also uses
          storage on your device to hold your library. Meeting these requirements is your
          responsibility, and they may change over time.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
        <p className={cn('caps')}>
          THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. TO THE FULLEST
          EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, {company.toUpperCase()} AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
          EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS (THE “{COMPANY.shortName.toUpperCase()}{' '}
          PARTIES”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
          STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, INTEROPERABILITY AND QUIET ENJOYMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT
          THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE
          CORRECTED, OR THAT ANY DATA WILL BE PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
          ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO PARTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU,
          AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS AFFECTS CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p className={cn('caps')}>
          TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE {COMPANY.shortName.toUpperCase()} PARTIES
          SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
          DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
          YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT SUCH
          DAMAGES ARE POSSIBLE. IN PARTICULAR, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE ABOVE, THE{' '}
          {COMPANY.shortName.toUpperCase()} PARTIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR DATA THAT CANNOT BE DECRYPTED
          BECAUSE A PASSWORD OR RECOVERY CODE HAS BEEN LOST. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS
          RELATING TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE
          TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR USD 50. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
          NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO PARTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT
          APPLY TO YOU.
        </p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold the {COMPANY.shortName} Parties harmless from any claims,
          losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your use
          of the Service, your content, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of any law or
          of anyone else’s rights. We may assume the exclusive defence of any matter subject to this
          indemnity, and you agree to cooperate with it.
        </p>

        <h2>Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          If a dispute arises out of or relating to these Terms, please contact us first at{' '}
          {SUPPORT_EMAIL} — most things are resolved that way. If we cannot resolve it:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Negotiation.</strong> The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve the
            dispute by negotiation within thirty days of written notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mediation.</strong> Failing that, the parties will attempt mediation, before a
            mediator they agree on or, failing agreement, one appointed by the Thailand Arbitration
            Center.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute not resolved by negotiation or mediation shall
            be settled by final and binding arbitration under the rules of the Thailand Arbitration
            Center, seated in Bangkok, before one or more neutral arbitrators.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Nothing in this section prevents either party from seeking urgent injunctive relief from a
          competent court, or affects any right you have as a consumer to bring proceedings in the
          courts of your country of residence where local law gives you that right.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and any dispute arising from them are governed by the laws of the Kingdom of
          Thailand, without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules, and the competent courts of
          Thailand have jurisdiction — subject in each case to any mandatory consumer protections
          that apply where you live.
        </p>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it will be limited
          or removed to the minimum extent necessary and the rest will remain in force. Our failure
          to enforce a provision is not a waiver of it. You may not assign your rights under these
          Terms without our written consent; we may assign ours in connection with a merger,
          acquisition or sale of assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms are an agreement between you and {COMPANY.shortName} alone, and not with any
          app store operator. An app store operator has no obligation to provide maintenance or
          support for the applications, and {COMPANY.shortName} — not the operator — is responsible
          for addressing any claim relating to them. App store operators and their subsidiaries are
          third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You confirm that you are not located in, and are not listed on any restricted-party list
          of, a country subject to an applicable trade embargo.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms are the entire agreement between you and {COMPANY.shortName} regarding the
          Service and supersede any earlier agreement or communication about it.
        </p>
