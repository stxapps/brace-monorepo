// A reachable support URL is a store-listing requirement (docs/brand.md), so this
// page has a second job beyond helping people: an App Store or Play reviewer will
// open it and look for a real contact route. Hence a plain, visible address
// rather than a form — this is a static export with no backend to post one to,
// and an obfuscated mailto is a worse experience for everybody including the
// reviewer.
//
// Deliberately NOT promised here: a response time. We are one small team across a
// single timezone, and an SLA on a marketing page is a commitment nobody
// remembers making at 2am on a Sunday. What is promised is that a person reads
// every message, which is true and is the part people actually want.
//
// The "what we can't do" block is the most useful thing on the page. Password
// recovery is the single most common support request an E2E app receives
// (docs/business-model.md, _related risks_), and the answer is always no — so it
// is stated before someone writes in hoping otherwise.
