    'Who makes Bracemark, why it encrypts everything on your device, and how a bookmark manager pays for itself without selling anything.',

// The story the product tells about itself, drafted from docs/brand.md (the name
// and the Brace.to lineage), docs/business-model.md (how it pays for itself) and
// docs/account.md (what "we can't read it" actually rests on).
//
// Two rules held throughout, because an About page is where marketing copy
// usually starts drifting from the build:
//   - No claim here outruns the code. There is no "open source" line, no roadmap
//     promise, and no feature that isn't shipping (docs/business-model.md,
//     _launch sequencing_).
//   - The trade-offs section is not modesty. An encrypted-by-construction app has
//     real costs — no recovery, no server-side search, no sharing — and a visitor
//     who discovers them after signing up feels misled. Better they read them
//     here, from us.

const FREE_LINKS = entitlementsOf('free').maxLinks;

// What the architecture costs, stated by us rather than discovered later. Each
// one is a direct consequence of the line above it in docs/local-first-sync.md.

              <p>
                What you save is a fairly complete picture of what you are reading, buying, worrying
                about and working on. Most bookmark managers hold that picture in readable form on
                their servers, and most of them mean well. But meaning well is a policy, and
                policies change with funding rounds, acquisitions, subpoenas and breaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                So Bracemark is built the other way round. Your password derives a key on your own
                device; every link, list and tag becomes its own encrypted file before it is
                uploaded; the server keeps a path, a size and some bytes. There is no “we promise
                not to look” in that sentence, because there is no looking available to promise
                against.

              <p>
                Bracemark is the second version of Brace.to, a bookmark manager we have run for
                years on a decentralised identity stack. That version worked, and the people who
                used it were generous with their patience — but it asked everyone to understand a
                blockchain account before they could save a link, and it was named after a domain
                nobody could say out loud.
              </p>
              <p>
                This version keeps the promise and drops the prerequisite. The encryption is now
                ours end to end: a key derived from a password you choose, with a recovery code as
                the second door. You sign up with a username. Nothing else.

                Subscriptions. That is the whole model. There is no advertising, no data to sell
                even if we wanted to, and no investor expecting one of those to appear later.

              <p>
                It works because the architecture that keeps us out of your library also keeps it
                cheap to run: we store opaque blobs and do no work on their contents, so a free
                account costs us a fraction of a cent a year. That is why the free plan can be{' '}
