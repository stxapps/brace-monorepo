// Every store requires a reachable privacy-policy URL, so this route must carry
// real content before submission (docs/brand.md).
//
// The substance was already decided and written down, and this page is a faithful
// reading of it rather than a template:
//   - the sync server is a blind broker that only ever sees ciphertext, plus the
//     account row and the wrapped keys (docs/local-first-sync.md, docs/account.md);
//   - bracemark-extractor is the ONE component that fetches user URLs. It holds no
//     key, persists nothing, and its rate limiter logs IP addresses but never URLs
//     (docs/link-extraction.md, docs/abuse.md);
//   - subscription rows come from the payment providers, never from card data we
//     hold, because we never hold any (docs/iap.md).
//
// The rule this page follows: describe what the system does, not what we intend.
// If a claim here is ever falsified by a change to the code, the change is wrong
// or this page is — either way it is a release blocker, which is why each claim
// is traceable to a doc above.
//
// NOT LEGAL ADVICE. GDPR/PDPA phrasing, the lawful-basis framing and the
// sub-processor list should be reviewed by a lawyer before launch, and the
// sub-processor list re-checked whenever the infrastructure changes
// (docs/deployment.md).

          This policy explains what {COMPANY.legalName} (“{COMPANY.shortName}”, “we”, “us”) collects
          when you use Bracemark, why, and what happens to it. It covers bracemark.com,
          app.bracemark.com, the Bracemark applications for iOS, Android, Chrome and Firefox, and
          the services behind them.
        </p>

        <h2>The short version</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We cannot read your saved links. They are encrypted on your device with a key derived
            from your password, which never reaches us.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not ask for your email address, and there is no advertising, no analytics product,
            no tracker and no data sold or shared for marketing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The only way we make money is the optional subscription — which is why our incentives
            and yours point the same way.
          </li>
          <li>You can export everything, and delete everything, from inside the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What we collect</h2>

        <h3>Your account</h3>
        <p>
          Creating an account stores three things: the <strong>username</strong> you chose, a{' '}
          <strong>public key</strong> used to verify that a sign-in request really comes from you,
          and one <strong>encrypted key blob</strong> for each way you can open the account (your
          password, and a recovery code if you made one). The blobs are locked with a key derived
          from your password or recovery code on your device — they are useless to us and to anyone
          who obtains them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not collect an email address, a phone number, a name, or any other identifier at
          sign-up. If you never write to us and never subscribe, we hold nothing that identifies you
          as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Signing in creates a <strong>session record</strong> — a hashed token, the account it
          belongs to, and timestamps — so your device stays signed in and you can sign other devices
          out.
        </p>

        <h3>Your library</h3>
        <p>
          Each saved link, list, tag and setting is stored as its own{' '}
          <strong>encrypted file</strong>. For each one we hold the file’s path, its size in bytes,
          and when it last changed — the minimum needed to sync your devices. We hold no titles, no
          web addresses, no tags, no notes, and no index over any of it, because none of that exists
          in a readable form on our side.
        </p>

        <h3>If you subscribe</h3>
        <p>
          Payments are processed by <strong>Paddle</strong> for web purchases and by{' '}
          <strong>Apple</strong> or <strong>Google</strong> for purchases made inside the apps. They
          collect and hold your payment details under their own privacy policies; we never receive
          or store your card number.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we store is a <strong>subscription record</strong>: the provider, that provider’s
          identifier for your subscription and customer, the plan, its status, and the dates it runs
          between. It is linked to your account so the app knows which features to unlock.
        </p>

        <h3>Technical and security data</h3>
        <p>
          Our infrastructure processes ordinary request data — including your{' '}
          <strong>IP address</strong>, the time of the request and your user agent — as any web
          service must in order to answer it. We use it to keep the service running and to apply
          rate limits against abuse, and we do not use it to build a profile of you or to track you
          between visits.
        </p>

        <h3>Link previews, if you turn them on</h3>
        <p>
          Titles and preview images are normally fetched by the device that saved the link — the
          browser extension reads the tab you are on, and the mobile apps fetch the page themselves.
          Neither involves our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For links saved in the web app, browsers do not allow a page to fetch another site, so
          there is an <strong>opt-in {PLAN_LABELS.plus} setting</strong> that lets our extraction
          service fetch the page on your behalf. It is off unless you turn it on. When it is on,
          that service receives the address you saved, fetches the page, returns the title and
          image, and keeps nothing: it stores no URLs, writes none to its logs, holds no key, and is
          not told which account asked. Its rate limiter does record IP addresses, so that a single
          source cannot abuse it.
        </p>

        <h3>If you contact us</h3>
        <p>
          When you email support we receive your message, your email address and whatever you choose
          to put in it. We keep the correspondence so we can follow up, and we use it only to help
          you.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and on-device storage</h2>
        <p>
          This website sets <strong>no cookies</strong> and loads no third-party scripts; the fonts
          are served from this domain rather than fetched from a font provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app stores data in your browser or device — your library, your session, and your
          preferences — using local storage and IndexedDB. That is what makes it work offline. It
          stays on your device, is not readable by us, and is cleared when you sign out or clear
          your browser data.
        </p>

        <h2>How we use what we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To provide the service: authenticate you, sync your encrypted files, unlock the plan you
            paid for.
          </li>
          <li>To keep it running and safe: diagnose faults, prevent abuse, enforce rate limits.</li>
          <li>To answer you when you write to us.</li>
          <li>To meet legal, tax and accounting obligations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not use your information for advertising, we do not sell or rent it, and we do not
          share it for anyone else’s marketing. There is no automated decision-making that produces
          legal effects for you.
        </p>

        <h2>Who else processes it</h2>
        <p>
          We use a small number of providers to run the service. They act on our instructions and
          receive only what their function requires.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloudflare</strong> — hosts the API and stores the encrypted files and the
            account records.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> — serves this website and the web app as static
            files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paddle</strong> — sells and processes web subscriptions as merchant of record,
            including tax.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> — distribute the mobile apps and
            process any subscription bought inside them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Namecheap (Private Email)</strong> — hosts the mailbox that receives your
            support email.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Beyond these, we disclose information only where we are legally required to — in response
          to a valid legal request — or where it is necessary to protect our rights or someone’s
          safety. What we can disclose is bounded by what we hold: encrypted files we cannot
          decrypt, and the account record described above. If we are ever part of a merger or sale
          of assets, this policy travels with the data and you will be told before it moves.
        </p>

        <h2>Where your data is</h2>
        <p>
          Our providers operate globally, so your encrypted files and account records may be stored
          and processed in countries other than the one you live in, including the United States.
          Where personal data is transferred out of the European Economic Area or the United
          Kingdom, our providers rely on the standard contractual clauses or an equivalent
          safeguard.
        </p>

        <h2>How long we keep it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Your account and library</strong> — until you delete them. Deleting all data
            wipes the stored files; deleting your account also destroys the encrypted key blobs,
            after which nothing could open the data even if a copy survived.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sessions</strong> — until they expire or you sign that device out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscription records</strong> — for as long as the subscription is live, and
            afterwards for as long as tax and accounting law requires.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support email</strong> — until it is no longer useful for supporting you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Abandoned accounts</strong> — we reserve the right to delete data for an account
            unused for two or more years, rather than hold it indefinitely.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Deleted usernames are retired rather than released, so nobody can register a name and be
          mistaken for its previous owner.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict or
          port your personal data, and to object to processing. Most of them you can exercise
          yourself, immediately, without asking us:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Access and portability</strong> — Settings → Data → Export, which gives you your
            whole library in open formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Correction</strong> — edit anything in the app; it is your data on your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Erasure</strong> — Settings → Data deletes your library; Settings → Account
            deletes the account itself.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For anything else — or if you want to complain about how we have handled your data — write
          to <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`}>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a>. You also have the right to
          complain to your local data protection authority. Note that we cannot help you access the
          contents of your library: we have no key, so the request is one only you can fulfil.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          Your library is encrypted on your device with AES-256-GCM, under a key derived from your
          password with Argon2id; connections use TLS; and the keys that open your account are
          stored only in a form that your password or recovery code can unlock. No system is
          perfectly secure, and we do not claim otherwise — but the design deliberately limits how
          much a breach of ours could reveal, because what we hold is not readable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please see the{' '}
          <Link href="/support">support page</Link> for how to report it.
        </p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
          Bracemark is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from
          them. If you believe a child has created an account, write to us and we will remove it.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy. The date at the top of the page shows when it last changed, and
          we will highlight any material change in the app. Continuing to use Bracemark after a
          change means you accept the updated policy.
        </p>
