// For opsz that default is NOT 96 despite what the served file's family name
// ("Bricolage Grotesque 96pt ExtraBold") suggests: that string is nameID 1 of
// the whole variable font, carried into the subset unchanged. Measured against
// the variable font swept across opsz, the subset we were shipping matches
// opsz 12-18 — the TEXT cut — which the site was then using for headlines up
// to 48px. Requesting the axis lets `font-optical-sizing: auto` (the browser
// default) pick per size, so headlines get the display cut and the 18px
// wordmark in site-header.tsx keeps the text cut it already had.
//
// `wdth` is deliberately NOT requested; see globals.css for why.

// RootLayout) expressed at the document level, and they move together.

// `#ffffff` is not a loose brand white — it is `--background` (`oklch(1 0 0)`)
// written in a syntax a `<meta>` accepts. It has to be a literal: the tag is
// emitted into `<head>` and cannot read a custom property.
//
// `colorScheme: 'light'` states the same thing for the UA's own painting — the
// canvas before CSS applies, scrollbars, and any form control — so a visitor whose
// OS is dark gets a white page rather than a dark flash that resolves to white.
// web-ui's `:root` already sets `color-scheme: light` in CSS; this repeats it as a
// meta because the commitment belongs to THIS app, and a light-only site should not
// be depending on a shared sheet's default to stay light.
//
// The moment the site gains a theme, both become the two-entry media form
// (`{ media: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)', color: … }`) — one is not correct
// without the other. → docs/theme.md, _per-app wiring_.

// not read anyway: it's a different origin, so it doesn't even share bracemark-web's
// localStorage mirror. The marketing pages are **light-only**, and that is a decision
// rather than a gap: the other three properties all support the four-mode theme
// (docs/theme.md), this one deliberately does not.
//
// The pages are nonetheless written against the shadcn TOKENS (`bg-background`,
// `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`) rather than literal greys, so the
// GREYSCALE half of a theme would come free. What would not is the site's own accent
// ramp — `--color-signal*` in globals.css is authored for a white ground and inverts
// badly (signal falls from 7.88:1 to 2.51:1 on the dark background; the two tints
// become a white panel and a glaring rule) — and the three inverted slabs, whose
// whole rhetoric is that dark is what the server sees. Numbers, and the mechanism to
// use if this is ever revisited, are in docs/theme.md, _per-app wiring_.
