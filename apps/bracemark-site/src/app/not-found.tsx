// The apex's 404. Static export, so this prerenders to `404.html` and CloudFront
// serves it for every unmatched path (docs/deployment.md) — meaning it is one page
// answering every wrong address, and it can't say which one was asked for. (It
// could, from `window.location`, but that would make the only 404 on a fully
// static, script-free site a client component to print back a string the reader
// just typed. Not worth the bundle.)
//
// It uses PageShell like every other non-landing page, so a mistyped URL lands
// somewhere that looks deliberate rather than somewhere the site fell over. The
// header and footer come from the root layout and are already the full nav — the
// list below is not a substitute for them, it's the three pages a lost visitor
// actually wants, in the order they want them.
//
// NO joke, no ASCII art, no giant 404. This site's whole argument is that it was
// built carefully by people who don't need your attention; a gag on the error page
// is the cheapest possible way to undercut that.
