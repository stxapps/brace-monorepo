            bookmark managers is where the encryption happens: each link is encrypted on your
            device, with a key derived from your password, before any of it syncs. We store the

            Browser bookmarks don’t follow you off that browser. The hosted managers do follow you,

            their server-side search and recommendations possible in the first place. Bracemark
            gives up those server-side features in exchange for a server that has nothing to read.
