// is single-threaded it is the natural place to mint the op log's monotonic seq,
// and a per-user alarm() can drive op-log compaction later.
//
// MIGRATIONS ARE IN CODE. A DO's SQLite is NOT a D1 database — `wrangler d1
// migrations apply` does not touch it. We track the applied version in a tiny
// `schema_version` table (NOT `PRAGMA user_version`: workerd's DO SQLite
// authorizer rejects that PRAGMA with SQLITE_AUTH) and apply any pending
// statements on construction, before the instance serves a request
// (blockConcurrencyWhile). The schema snapshot in do/README.md mirrors this for
// at-a-glance reference only and is not applied by any tool. See do/README.md.

// Ordered schema versions: entry i upgrades schema_version i -> i+1. APPEND ONLY
// — never edit a shipped entry (DOs already past it won't re-run it). Each entry
// is a list of single statements (SqlStorage.exec runs one statement per call).

  // pull is a keyset scan ordered by (updated_at, path) (op-logs.ts listSince), so
  // index that exact tuple. `file_sizes` is the quota's source of truth — set on
  // every committed put, read-and-subtracted on delete (file-sizes.ts) — kept
  // separate from the compactable op log so it never undercounts.

  // by the caller in services/sync.ts, which passes only the survivors in. The log
  // must never point at an object that isn't in R2 (op-without-object 404s every
  // client that pulls it; an object with no op is harmless and healed by the
  // fallback R2 listing), so the service HEADs R2, never hands a put without an

  //  - put:    R2's authoritative `LastModified`, with `size` its reported size,
  //            recorded in the quota map.
  //  - delete: the worker's commit clock (no object survives to HEAD), and the
  //            path's recorded size is freed from the quota map (`size` ignored).
  // Mixing the two clocks is safe because paths are immutable random ids — a path
  // is only ever put…put…delete, so a put and a delete on it never have to be
  // ordered against each other. Running the whole batch in one RPC keeps it to a
