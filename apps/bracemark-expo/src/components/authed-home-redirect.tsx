// Authed visitors to the public landing ('/') belong in the app, so bounce them
// to /links — the same rule GuestGuard applies to /sign-in and /create-account.
//
// This has no web sibling any more. On the web the landing page moved off the app
// origin entirely, to bracemark-site on the apex (docs/deployment.md), so
// bracemark-web's `/` is now an unconditional router (components/home-redirect.tsx).
// A native app has no apex to send anyone to — its landing screen has to live in the
// binary — so `src/app/index.tsx` keeps rendering a real hero and this stays.
//
// Renders null in loading / unauthenticated, so the landing hero shows for guests
// with no flash; it only acts once AuthProvider has hydrated to 'authenticated'.
// No ?next= here: the root is never a return target, so /links is the only
// destination. Uses expo-router's declarative <Redirect> (navigate-on-mount) in
// place of web's render-phase redirect() throw — so an authed visitor sees the
// landing for a frame before the redirect lands (vs. web unmounting before
// commit), acceptable for the rare already-signed-in-hits-root case.
