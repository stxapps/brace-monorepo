// The auth card, with its top-right corner taken off at 45° — the brand mark's
// own gesture (a page corner turned down to keep a place; see
// components/icons/bracemark-icon.tsx) performed at screen scale. It is the RN
// port of bracemark-web's `(auth)/layout.tsx` `DogEaredCard`, and everything that
// file decides is inherited rather than re-argued: the fold is the ONE memorable
// thing on these two screens and everything around it stays plain, because a
// sign-in box that reaches for two ideas reads as a phishing page rather than a
// designed one.
//
// SIZE. 24px (web's 1.5rem), and it is set against the card rather than against
// the mark's own 29% ratio: a step above the 16px corner radius it sits beside,
// so it can't be misread as a heavier rounding, and level with the 24px padding
// it aligns to. The mark's ratio only reads as a silhouette on ~40px objects
// (docs/brand.md, _the mark_); at card scale it would be a shape, not a fold.
//
// WHY AN SVG AND NOT A CLIPPED VIEW. Web draws this as two stacked elements
// sharing a `clip-path` — a 1px sheet of the ring colour with the card inset
// into it — because `clip-path` erases the ring along with everything else. RN
// has no clip-path at all, so the usual native trick is a rotated square in the
// PAGE colour laid over the corner. That trick cannot carry a hairline: the
// diagonal would be the only one of the card's five edges with no border, which
// is exactly the edge the whole device is about. So the card's outline is one
// filled-and-stroked path instead, sized from the content's measured box. One
// element, a real hairline the whole way round, and the fold is a property of
// the shape rather than something painted over it.
//
// NO SHADOW, deliberately, where web has a weak `drop-shadow`. Web needs it
// because `clip-path` erases a box-shadow and because a white card on `--muted`
// is a 3% step there; RN's `shadow-*` would paint the shadow of the CONTENT
// BOX — a plain rectangle — so the fold would sit inside a rectangular halo and
// read as a chipped corner rather than a turned one. Web's own note says the
// shadow doesn't show in dark and that the card separates by lightness there;
// on native the stroked hairline does that job in both themes.
//
// Colours come from the active Uniwind theme via `useCSSVariable`, the same
// mechanism and reasoning as the mark itself: react-native-svg takes fill and
// stroke as PROPS, so there is no `currentColor` and no className to resolve
// against. They re-read when `Uniwind.setTheme` fires (components/theme-provider).
