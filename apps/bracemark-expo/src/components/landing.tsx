// The public landing UI. Presentational, and kept OUT of `src/app/` so its spec
// can sit beside it — every file under the app root becomes a route. The route
// that renders it (`src/app/index.tsx`) owns the navigation concerns (the authed
// redirect); this component just renders. Its CTAs deep-link into the `(auth)`
// group, which adds no URL segment, so the hrefs are `/create-account` /
// `/sign-in`.
//
// Its web counterpart is bracemark-site's hero on the marketing apex, NOT
// bracemark-web's `/`, which is a bare redirect (docs/deployment.md). A native app
// can't hand off to a website for its first screen, so this landing ships in the
// binary — and it inherits that page's design rule verbatim: ACHROMATIC, AND IT
// SHOWS ALMOST NOTHING, because "the server sees nothing" is easier to feel on a
// screen that does the same. What was here before — a wordmark over "Save links
// to visit later." — said what a hundred bookmark apps say, in raw
// `gray-900`/`gray-950` palette values that ignored the token set the rest of the
// app is built on (and, being blue-tinted, disagreed with the neutral card the
// next screen shows).
//
// THE HIERARCHY IS THE POINT, and it is the one brand.md sets: the NAME does not
// tell anyone what this is ("Bracemark" reads faintly orthodontic on first
// encounter), so the name stays at lockup scale and the TAGLINE gets the hero
// weight. The tagline's one weakness is that "can't read" can momentarily parse
// as broken rather than blind — which is why the slogan sits under it as the
// sign-off rather than anywhere else on the screen: the two lines resolve each
// other, and brand.md says the tagline is safest exactly where supporting copy
// does that immediately.
//
// All three lines come from `BRAND` (shared `stores/listing-copy.ts`) rather than
// being typed here. That file exists because five consoles and three apps have to
// agree on them, and this screen is a store screenshot's worth of surface — a
// hand-typed variant would ship to a storefront and disagree with the listing
// beside it.

// Core host components (View, Text) accept `className` directly; SafeAreaView is
// a composite component, so Uniwind's HOC is needed to bridge className→style.
