// Shared chrome for the auth screens (/create-account, /sign-in) — the native
// merge of bracemark-web's `(auth)/layout.tsx` (the lockup, the dog-eared card, the
// encryption line) and each page's CardHeader/Content/Footer sections. No nav —
// these screens are intentionally focused. The route group's `_layout.tsx` keeps
// only the GuestGuard + Stack; this component owns the visuals, so it lives
// outside `src/app/` (every file under the app root becomes a route).
//
// THE LOCKUP IS HERE FOR THE SAME REASON WEB'S IS. These two screens are the
// only place in the signed-in app rendered with no drawer, so they are the only
// place it never says its own name — and a native app has no tab title to fall
// back on, which makes the case STRONGER here than on web. Three entry points
// drop a user in mid-flow with nothing else identifying the origin: the landing
// hero's two CTAs, and the share sheet bouncing a not-signed-in save.
//
// The background is `--muted` / `--background`, not a raw palette pair. Web's
// layout carries the argument: `--muted` INVERTS relative to `--card` between
// themes (light muted 0.97 is darker than the card at 1.0; dark muted 0.269 is
// LIGHTER than the card at 0.205), so reusing it in dark would sink the card
// into the page — in dark the page drops to `--background` and the card lifts
// off it instead.
//
// Mobile-only concerns web's layout doesn't have: the scroll view keeps long
// content (the ceremony's recovery step) reachable on small screens, and it's
// keyboard-controller's KeyboardAwareScrollView because the keyboard overlays
// the window on BOTH platforms now — with edge-to-edge (enforced on
// Android 15+) `adjustResize` no longer resizes the window, and RN core only
// emits keyboard events without moving anything. It scrolls the focused field
// clear of the keyboard, frame-synced with the keyboard animation
// (KeyboardProvider lives in the root `_layout.tsx`). `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`
// lets a tap on a button land while the keyboard is up instead of only
// dismissing it.

// Both are composites (not core hosts), so they need Uniwind's HOC to accept
// `className` — which also maps KeyboardAwareScrollView's
// `contentContainerClassName` onto `contentContainerStyle`.
