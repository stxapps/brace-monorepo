// The one object the share sheet is about — the page — drawn the way the
// library draws it, and the only thing on this surface whose SHAPE changes when
// the save lands. It is the RN port of bracemark-extension's
// `popup/PageSpecimen.tsx` (that header is canonical), down to the
// measurements: a 44px identity tile, a 15px title, `gap-3.5`, and a 12px
// corner cut.
//
// WHY THE EXTENSION'S COMPONENT AND NOT A NEW ONE. The share sheet and the
// browser-extension popup are the same product moment on two platforms — "this
// page, saved or not" — and the popup already learned the lesson this screen
// hadn't. Saving used to read as submitting a form and being handed a receipt:
// a compose screen, then a separate "✓ Saved to Bracemark" screen, two screens
// with nothing visibly in common. Now the page is on screen the whole time and
// the save happens TO it — the controls beneath it change, the specimen stays
// put, and its corner comes off.
//
// THE CORNER IS THE SAVE, and it is the meaning the fold ALREADY carries on the
// extension's tile (docs/brand.md, _the mark_: square is unsaved, cut is
// saved) — the same meaning on the same job, not a third one. No check badge,
// no colour, no state word competing with the title.
//
// TWO DIVERGENCES FROM THE WEB SPECIMEN, both forced by where this runs:
//
//   - THE TILE IS ALWAYS THE MONOGRAM. Web's chain is extracted image → the
//     live tab's favicon → HostMonogram. The sheet has neither of the first two
//     and must not go looking: it never fetches the page, and the iOS extension
//     must stay clear of bytes-heavy work and of the app's sqlite, where a
//     cached favicon would live (docs/share-sheet.md). So the deterministic
//     tile is the whole chain — and it is the SAME tile the library will draw
//     for this host (features/links/link-media.tsx's Monogram, over shared's
//     hueFromHost/initialFromHost), so "same site, same mark" still holds
//     between the sheet and the list it saves into.
//   - THE CUT IS AN OVERLAY, NOT A CLIP. RN has no `clip-path`. The hairline
//     objection that rules this trick out for the auth card
//     (components/dog-eared-card.tsx, which draws a stroked SVG outline
//     instead) does not apply at tile scale: web's own tile loses its ring
//     along the diagonal too, because `clip-path` erases the ring with
//     everything else. A rotated square in the page colour therefore reproduces
//     the web result exactly rather than approximating it — and it costs no SVG
//     in a bundle whose init cost is paid on every cold share.

// The overlay that takes the corner off: a square rotated 45° and centred on the
// tile's top-right corner. Its half-diagonal is the cut, so its lower-left edge
// runs exactly from (TILE − CUT, 0) to (TILE, CUT) — the chamfer — and its body
// covers everything beyond, the rounded corner's arc included (the arc sits
// 3.3px from the corner, the chamfer 8.5px, so nothing of it survives). Painted
// in `--background` because that is what the specimen always sits on; it spills
// past the tile by half its width onto the same colour, so no clipping is needed
// and none is applied — `overflow-hidden` plus a transform is the one
// combination that renders differently across the two platforms.
