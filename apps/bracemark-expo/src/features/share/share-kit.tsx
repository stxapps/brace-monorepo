// The share sheet's chrome — the frame, the header, the disclosure row, the
// terminal notice. Split out of share-screen.tsx for the reason
// features/settings/settings-kit.tsx exists one level up: the sheet is now four
// screens (compose, saved, choose-list, add-tags) sharing one frame, and a
// frame typed into four places drifts into four sheets.
//
// EVERY IMPORT HERE IS ON THE iOS EXTENSION'S CRITICAL PATH. share-root.tsx's
// header is the fence; two consequences show up in this file:
//
//   - LUCIDE IS DEEP-IMPORTED (`lucide-react-native/icons/x`), the only corner
//     of the app that does. The barrel is ~1600 icon modules and Metro does not
//     tree-shake, so `import { X } from 'lucide-react-native'` executes all of
//     them on every cold share. On Android that costs nothing — the share
//     activity rides the main bundle, where the barrel is already resident —
//     but iOS pays it per share, and docs/share-sheet.md asks for exactly this
//     graph to be policed. The subpath is a declared package export with types
//     (`./icons/*`), resolved by Metro and jest alike under the `react-native`
//     condition, not a reach into dist/.
//   - NO PORTALS, NO REANIMATED. Nothing here is a Dialog or a DropdownMenu;
//     the pickers are screens within the sheet rather than overlays over it.

// Only the bottom edge, and `additive` so the inset stacks on the panel's own
// padding rather than replacing it. This is the one tree in the app outside any
// SafeAreaProvider (docs/safe-area.md) — which is fine, and worth knowing:
// `SafeAreaView` is a NATIVE view that measures its own insets and reads no
// context, unlike `useSafeAreaInsets`. The other three edges are `off`: the iOS
// host view is bottom-pinned and 520pt tall, so it never reaches the notch, and
// Android's panel is bottom-anchored under a full-bleed backdrop.
//
// It was previously omitted entirely, and the omission was visible: the Save
// button's bottom edge sat 16px off the screen bottom on iOS, i.e. underneath
// the home indicator's own swipe region.

// The sheet's frame. Two very different native hosts, one tree below this
// point (docs/share-sheet.md):
//
//   - iOS — expo-share-extension provides the floating panel itself: a
//     bottom-pinned, 520pt-tall root view whose background is `.systemBackground`
//     and whose corners are SQUARE (its ShareExtensionViewController sets no
//     corner radius). So this fills it rather than drawing a panel inside it —
//     rounding our own content would leave the host's square corners painted
//     behind it. Content is bottom-aligned within the fixed height, which is
//     what keeps Save under the thumb on a screen that is 520pt tall no matter
//     how short the screen above it is.
//   - Android — the activity is translucent and full-screen, so the panel IS
//     ours: rounded top, tap-to-dismiss backdrop, capped at 85% so a long list
//     can never swallow the whole window.
//
// Keyboard: both hosts overlay it, so the sheet moves itself. Deliberately a
// plain KeyboardAvoidingView, NOT react-native-keyboard-controller like the app
// tree — its iOS native layer is built on `UIApplication.shared`, which does not
// exist in an extension process (docs/safe-area.md, _keyboard avoidance_).
// `behavior="padding"` on both so the two hosts render the same tree.

//     this is a surface with no other brand carrier, floating over somebody
//     else's app, and until now it never said whose sheet it was. The close
//     control is not decoration either — on iOS there is no backdrop to tap and
//     no swipe to dismiss, so before this the compose screen had no way out
//     except saving.
//   - a SUB-SCREEN'S header — a back control labelled with the screen you are
//     on, since there is exactly one place back goes.
//
// `dismissible` drops the close control for the screens that already end in a
// Close button (ShareNotice, the quota banner) — the X and that button say the
// same word, and the reason the X exists at all is that the compose screen has
// no other way out. The lockup stays on every one of them: a sheet telling you
// to go and sign in is precisely a sheet that has to say whose it is.
