// The settings design system: the column, the headings, the row, the notice —
// the RN port of bracemark-web's `(app)/settings/_components/settings-kit.tsx`,
// component for component and step for step.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every one of these was typed by hand in each section, and the
// count is the argument, the same one web's file makes: the page wrapper
// (`px-6 py-8`) appeared in all seven sections, the section heading in all seven,
// the block heading (`mt-10` + `text-base font-medium` + a muted line) nineteen
// times — in four different top margins — and the error box in five, in three
// different treatments. Self-containment is right for a section's LOGIC; it is
// how seven sections drift into looking like seven products. A control the user
// has never seen should sit at the same inset, on the same hairline, at the same
// heading step as the one they saw a minute ago — that consistency is the entire
// design of a settings surface.
//
// The measure is `max-w-2xl` with `px-6`, which is what bracemark-web's settings
// pane and the browser extension's options page are both set to. On a phone the
// cap never binds and this is just the padding; on a tablet it stops a column of
// controls stretching to 1024px. Three surfaces, one measure — a user who has
// seen one should not be able to tell they have changed apps.
//
// WHAT IS NOT PORTED: web's `focus-visible:` rings, which have no meaning
// without a keyboard, and its `hover:` states, which have no meaning without a
// pointer. Both become `active:` — the press feedback that IS the native
// affordance. The gap that leaves is real and is filled elsewhere: web's rows
// are `<button>`s that announce themselves; these are Pressables, so the ones
// that navigate carry the chevron as their whole affordance.

// The column every section renders into, inside the page's ScrollView
// (scroll-host.tsx). `gap-6` is the rhythm between a section's top-level blocks,
// so no section adds its own top margin to the ones it happens to have — the
// spacing is a property of the page, not of whoever wrote the block. Nest a
// plain View for anything that needs to sit tighter than that.

// The section's title and the line under it. This is the screen's heading — the
// topbar's copy of the section name is a surface label on a bar the drawer can
// cover, not the document's title, so the section you navigated to gets the
// weight here. Sub-views (Change password, Import data) render this too: they
// replace the whole pane rather than nesting inside it, so each is the heading
// while it is up.
//
// `back` turns it into a sub-view's header. Account and Data both drill from an
// overview into sub-views, and both had their own copy of the back link sitting
// loose above the title — so it belongs to the header rather than to the pane,
// and the pair moves as one block.
