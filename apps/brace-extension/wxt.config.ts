// SYNCHRONOUSLY before first paint, which a deferred module `main.tsx` can't do — so
// it has to be a parser-blocking classic <script> in <head>. It reads the
// `brace-theme` localStorage mirror that ThemeProvider keeps warm. Same single source
// brace-web inlines via layout.tsx.
//
// It CANNOT be inlined here, though: MV3's extension-page CSP is locked to
// `script-src 'self'` and the manifest validator rejects every escape hatch that
// would allow inline execution — 'unsafe-inline', nonces, AND sha256 hashes all fail
// to load ("Insecure CSP value"). So we emit it as a same-origin file and reference it
// with <script src> (which 'self' permits). A local extension-file fetch is instant,
// so a parser-blocking external script prevents FOUC exactly as the inline one did.
// The file is generated from themeInitScript() (not committed) so it can't drift; it
// lives in public/ because WXT serves that dir in dev and copies it to the output root
// on build — see THEME_INIT_FILENAME. Written at config load so it exists before WXT
