// The expo half of the Lists drag-and-drop pair — the mirror of brace-web's

// math is pure shape and identical on both platforms, so it lives in
// `@stxapps/shared` (`sync/tree-dnd.ts`); what stays here is what's genuinely
// this platform's — the px indent and the options every call site passes.
//
// The drag layer itself (gesture + animation) is drag-sort.tsx; this module is
// only the arithmetic's platform calibration.

// the tree indent the section already used before it could be dragged.

// `stepThreshold` is the touch calibration, and the reason the option exists: a
// finger dragging vertically jitters horizontally by several px the whole way,
// so web's plain rounding (change level at HALF an indent — right for a precise
// pointer) would reparent rows by accident here. Three quarters of an indent —
// 12px — is past the jitter but still an easy, deliberate nudge.
