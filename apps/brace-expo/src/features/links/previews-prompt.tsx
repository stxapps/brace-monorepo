// The first-run offer for on-device link previews — the one thing that keeps
// "off by default" honest rather than punitive (docs/link-extraction.md — _expo
// drains in the foreground_: the app should offer the opt-in at the first moment
// it MEANS something, so the honest default costs one tap instead of a settings
// expedition).
//
// It shows on the links screen when all three hold: the extraction mode is still
// the default `saves`, this device hasn't dismissed the offer, and there are
// actually links waiting for a preview. That last condition is the point — a fresh
// account with nothing saved gets no banner, and neither does a library that's
// already fully previewed.
//
// It arms on `saves` SPECIFICALLY, not on "anything below `all`" (entities.ts
// DEVICE_EXTRACTION_MODES): `saves` is the default nobody chose, which is exactly
// what an offer is for, while `off` is a decision the user made — and re-asking
// someone who picked "never contact these sites" is nagging, not onboarding. The
// settings section stays the way back up from `off`.
//
// The count comes from `readRawPendingTitleImageCount` (four index counts, no
// decode, no trash-correction join), not `useExtractionCounts`: the exact tally
// is gated on the drain being ENABLED, which is precisely what this banner exists
// to ask about. Raw pending is a strict over-count, which is the right side to err
// on for a "you have links without previews" prompt — and the read runs ONLY while
// the banner could show, so it costs nothing in steady state.
