// The 404 for app.bracemark.com. bracemark-web is a static export, so this renders
// once at build time into `404.html` and CloudFront serves it for every path that
// doesn't exist (docs/deployment.md) — which means it must make sense to BOTH a
// signed-in user who mistyped a route and a signed-out stranger who followed a
// stale link. Hence one destination, `/links`, and nothing that assumes a session:
// AuthGuard turns that into /sign-in for a visitor who has none.
//
// The heading is sized up from CardTitle's default (`text-base font-medium`, the
// SECTION step — right for a settings card sitting among five others) to
// bracemark-web's page step, the same `text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight` the
// sign-in and settings pages use, because this card IS the entire page.
//
// NO GIANT NUMERAL, no apology, no joke. The status code is an annotation above
// the sentence (CardEyebrow), because "404" tells a person nothing they can act on
// and the reassurance below it is the only content on this screen that does.
