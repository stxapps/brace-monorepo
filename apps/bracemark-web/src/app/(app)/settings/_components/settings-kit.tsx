// The settings design system: the column, the headings, the row, the notice.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every one of these was typed by hand in each section, and the
// count is the argument: the page wrapper appeared 10 times, the section heading
// 10 times, the bordered row 18 times — in four different paddings — and both
// `ActionRow` and `BackLink` existed twice, byte-identical, under a comment
// explaining that the sections are "self-contained by design". Self-contained is
// right for a section's LOGIC; it is how the seven sections drifted into looking
// like seven products. A control the user has never seen should sit at the same
// inset, on the same hairline, at the same heading step as the one they saw a
// minute ago — that consistency is the entire design of a settings surface.
//
// The measure is `max-w-2xl` with `px-6`, which is also the browser extension's
// options page (its `OptionsShell` says so, and cites this page as the source).
// The two are the same product's settings reached from two places; keep them
// equal, and change them together.

// The scrolling column every section renders into. `gap-6` is the rhythm between
// a section's top-level blocks, so no section adds its own `mt-*` to the ones it
// happens to have — the spacing is a property of the page, not of whoever wrote
// the block. Nest a plain div for anything that needs to sit tighter than that.

// The section's title and the line under it. This is the page's `h1` — the
// topbar's "Settings" is a surface label, not a heading (see topbar.tsx), so the
// section you navigated to is the document's title and gets the weight. Sub-views
// (Change password, Import data) render this too: they replace the whole pane
// rather than nesting inside it, so each is the h1 while it's up.
//
// `back` turns it into a sub-view's header. Account and Data both drill from an
// overview into sub-views (Change password, Import data, …), and both had their
// own copy of the back link sitting loose above the title — so it belongs to the
// header rather than to the pane, and the pair moves as one block.
