// Typed Workers runtime context for the whole extractor app. Hono is parameterized
// with `AppEnv` (see app.ts), so `c.env` (bindings) is typed in middleware + routes.
//
// brace-extractor runs ONLY on Cloudflare Workers (no Node entry), so every binding
// arrives on `c.env` at runtime, provided per-env by wrangler.jsonc. The one
// exception is tests: `app.request()` with no third arg runs with NO env, so
// `c.env` is `undefined` there — middleware must tolerate missing bindings (see how
// corsOrigins() and the rate-limit middleware guard for it).
//
// The binding set is deliberately TINY vs. brace-api: the extractor is anonymous
// and stateless (no D1/R2/DO, no key, no session), so there is nothing here but CORS
// config and the native rate limiters.

// The native Workers Rate Limiting binding. Its type isn't shipped in
// @cloudflare/workers-types yet, so declare the slice we use. Window/volume are
// configured per-binding in wrangler.jsonc; the binding only exposes
// `limit({ key })` at runtime.

  // fetch endpoints fetch arbitrary URLs but have different load shapes: /v1/extract
  // is one (batched) request per page → `tight`; /v1/image fans out to one request
  // per link → its own higher-burst `image` tier (see middleware/rate-limit.ts).
