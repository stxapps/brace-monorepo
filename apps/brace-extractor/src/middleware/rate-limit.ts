// endpoint that fetches any URL and streams bytes is an open proxy / DDoS reflector
// / bandwidth amplifier by default (docs "Abuse caps are load-bearing"). IP rate-
// limiting alone is weak (botnets, shared NAT) — the per-response byte ceiling +
// timeout in the fetch path are its necessary complement, and the documented
// upgrade is blind capability tokens (Privacy Pass), not a session.
