## local-first sync

How brace keeps data on the device as the source of truth and syncs end-to-end
encrypted files to the server. See [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for the
package layering, [api-contracts.md](./api-contracts.md) for the contract-first
endpoint pattern this builds on, and [account.md](./account.md) for the
password-derived data key (`@stxapps/web-crypto`) that protects every blob
described here.

### the shape of the problem

brace is **local-first**, with **one entity per encrypted file** and
**end-to-end encryption**:

- an entity (a bookmark's metadata, its content/archive, a tag, a list, the
  settings) is encrypted on the client, then uploaded as an opaque blob to
  storage (Cloudflare R2) via a signed URL;
- on download, the blob is fetched, decrypted, and written to a local store
  (IndexedDB via Dexie);
- the UI reads from the local store, never from the network.

The decisive constraint is that **the server only ever sees ciphertext.** The
Hono/Workers API and R2 cannot read, index, query, diff, or conflict-resolve on
content. That rules out the server-intelligent local-first frameworks
(ElectricSQL, PowerSync, TanStack DB) — their value is server-side knowledge of
your data, which E2E encryption forbids — and makes the key-value / document
sync engines (Replicache, RxDB replication) an awkward fit, since our transport
is "encrypted blob per file via signed URL," not row/document sync. This is the
Gaia/Blockstack per-file encrypted-storage model — well-trodden ground.

So the data path splits into **two layers**: we use a library for the local
store and hand-roll the file-sync engine. Don't conflate "don't use a sync
framework" with "build everything from scratch."

```
UI ──reads──▶ local store (IndexedDB) ◀──writes── sync engine ──▶ Hono API / R2
   ◀reactive──┘   [LIBRARY: Dexie]                  [HAND-ROLLED]
                                          encrypt before PUT / decrypt after GET
```

### layer 1 — local store + reactivity (use a library)

This is the cache and the source of truth for reads. The UI subscribes to it and
re-renders when sync writes land. **Don't rebuild IndexedDB plumbing by hand.**

- **Dexie** (IndexedDB) — `liveQuery` for reactive reads; simplest and most
  flexible. The preferred default.
- stores **decrypted** entities for fast local reads;
- exposes **reactive queries** so components update when the store changes;
- owns only on-device data — no network concerns leak in here.

Dexie holds:

- decrypted bookmark metadata, tags, lists, settings (the always-resident index);
- decrypted content/archive blobs (fetched lazily, on demand);
- the **sync cursor** — the compound `(updatedAt, path)` of the newest op/file
  the client has reconciled, stored as `syncCursorUpdatedAt` + `syncCursorPath`
  (the high-water mark for the next incremental pull — see _the sync endpoint_);
- the **pending-ops queue** — local mutations not yet committed to the server
  (this is what makes offline writes durable and drives crash recovery); each
  entry carries the **base `updatedAt`** the edit started from (the path's stored
  server timestamp at edit time), which reconcile uses to tell a clean
  fast-forward from a true conflict (see _a sync cycle_);
- per-path **R2 `updatedAt`** — the server-assigned `LastModified` for each file,
  used by both incremental apply and the fallback comparison (see below).

### layer 2 — sync engine (hand-roll)

Runs at the app/background level, not component-scoped. It owns the sync cursor,
the crypto boundary (encrypt before PUT / decrypt after GET via
`@stxapps/web-crypto`; plaintext never crosses the network), the upload queue
(with retry/backoff and offline handling), and the conflict policy.

It talks to the API through the shared **contract client** (see
[api-contracts.md](./api-contracts.md)). Because it runs outside React, it calls
`callEndpoint` directly — no hooks:

```ts
import { callEndpoint, opsListEndpoint } from '@stxapps/shared';
const { ops, oldestUpdatedAt, newestUpdatedAt, hasMore } = await callEndpoint(
  { baseUrl: API_URL },
  opsListEndpoint,
  // the cursor is the compound (updatedAt, path), not a seq — see *the ops/list endpoint*
  { since: syncCursorUpdatedAt, sincePath: syncCursorPath, limit: 500 },
);
```

The whole control plane is **four endpoints**, two per resource — `ops` (the
op-log entries) and `files` (the R2 objects):

```
GET  /v1/ops/list      incremental pull: ops since the cursor      (→ the ops/list endpoint)
POST /v1/ops/commit    record committed mutations (batched; HEADs puts, deletes objects) (→ the three flows: push)
GET  /v1/files/list    fallback R2 listing, paginated (download-truth) (→ fallback full sync)
POST /v1/files/sign    mint presigned R2 URL(s); op: 'put' | 'get' (→ authorization & quota)
```

**Every endpoint is bounded — never one-path-per-call, never unbounded.** The two
shapes bound differently: the **reads** (`ops/list`, `files/list`) return many and
**paginate** under a `limit`/page size, so a client pages forward with a cursor
rather than pulling an open-ended response; the **writes** (`ops/commit`,
`files/sign`) accept many and **batch** under a `.min(1).max(1000)` array, so a
first-sync push of thousands of files is a handful of round trips, and a request
over the cap `400`s at the contract before any work runs (the abuse gate). The
batch caps for the two writes are the same number (`1000`).

All four live in `apps/brace-api/src/routes/sync.ts` (each behind `requireAuth`).
The op-plane endpoints (`ops/list`, `ops/commit`) are thin passthroughs to the
user's Durable Object; the file-plane logic — paging R2, the quota gate, the
presigner — is in `services/sync.ts`. The shared contracts are in
`@stxapps/shared` (`sync/endpoints.ts`).

The blob bytes themselves never touch the API — the client PUTs/GETs R2 directly
over a `files/sign` URL. So `files/sign` is the **only** endpoint on the hot path
of bulk data, and it's deliberately a thin envelope check (ownership + quota), not
a content gateway. The signed URL is an **AWS SigV4 presign of R2's S3 endpoint**
(`lib/r2-presign.ts`), because the Workers R2 _binding_ can read/write objects
from inside the Worker but can't mint a URL the browser can use directly; the S3
access keys come from per-env secrets (`R2_*` in `wrangler.jsonc` / `lib/env.ts`).

### storage layout

**Cloudflare R2** (private bucket; all access via signed URLs). One entity = one
encrypted file. Random ids — never content-derived — so filenames leak nothing:

```
/users/{uid}/meta/{id}.enc        ← encrypted bookmark metadata (small, < ~2 KB)
/users/{uid}/files/{id}.enc       ← encrypted content / archived page / screenshot
/users/{uid}/tags/{id}.enc        ← encrypted { id, name, updatedAt }
/users/{uid}/lists/{id}.enc       ← encrypted { id, name, updatedAt }
/users/{uid}/settings/general.enc ← encrypted general user settings
```

A bookmark's metadata references the other files by id; the reference graph lives
**inside** the ciphertext, so the server never sees it:

```json
{
  "title": "Some Article",
  "url": "https://...",
  "tags": ["tag_id_1", "tag_id_2"],
  "list": "list_id_1",
  "pageArchive": "{id}.enc",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "..."
}
```

**Per-user op log** lives in a **Cloudflare Durable Object** (one DO per user,
addressed by `idFromName(userId)`), backed by the DO's SQLite. See
`apps/brace-api/src/do/user-data.ts` and `do/repositories/op-logs.ts`. Each row is
`{ seq, op: 'put' | 'delete', path, updated_at }`, where **`updated_at` is
R2's `LastModified`** for that path (read via a `HEAD` at commit — see _push_),
and the **client's sync cursor is that timestamp**, never `seq`.

`seq` (`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`) stays **internal**: it orders rows
that share a millisecond and drives compaction, but it never goes over the wire.
Keeping the cursor on R2's clock rather than on `seq` is deliberate — a sequence
number is only meaningful inside one DO's lifetime and **cannot be reconstructed
from an R2 listing**, so a DO rebuild or a fallback would have no valid seq to
resume from. An R2 timestamp always can: the newest `LastModified` in a listing
_is_ the cursor. A DO rebuild or seq reset therefore can't invalidate a client
cursor, and a wiped log is rebuildable from R2.

### source of truth: R2 is truth, the op log is an accelerator

**R2 is the source of truth. The op log is a derived accelerator that may be
empty.** This one sentence resolves most of the edge cases below: if the op log
is wiped or compacted, clients fall back to listing R2 and lose nothing but
speed.

The op log exists only to make incremental sync fast (pull "what changed since
timestamp T" instead of listing every file). It is safe to compact aggressively —
**keep the last 30 days or the last 10 000 ops per user, whichever is more** —
and safe to lose entirely.

The critical invariant, and the reason the commit protocol is ordered the way it
is:

> **The op log may lag R2, but must never point ahead of it.**

- `object-without-op` (an R2 object with no op-log entry — e.g. a commit died
  after the R2 PUT) is **tolerable**: it is invisible to incremental pull but
  reconciled by the fallback list.
- `op-without-object` (an op-log entry whose R2 object doesn't exist) is **much
  worse**: every client that pulls that op tries to download a 404.

That asymmetry is exactly why the op-log append runs **after** the R2 write
succeeds (see the `commitOps` comment in `user-data.ts`).

### data model: everything is one entity per file

Bookmarks, content blobs, **tags, lists, and settings are all just files**, and
all sync through the identical code path: last-writer-wins per file, `put` /
`delete` ops, the same upload queue. There is no special "merge by key" logic for
tag/list names.

- **Tags and lists** are stored one per file (`tags/{id}.enc`,
  `lists/{id}.enc`), each holding `{ id, name, updatedAt }`. Bookmark metadata
  stores only the **ids**, so renaming a tag/list rewrites one small file and
  touches no bookmarks. Rename = `put`; delete = `delete`. This is what lets two
  devices rename two _different_ tags concurrently without clobbering each other
  — a single shared `tags.enc` file under LWW could not.
- **Settings use a fixed `settings/` namespace** (`settings/general.enc` today).
  Unlike every other file — a random id (see _storage layout_) — these are
  **well-known paths** baked into client code, the one non-random-id family.
  Splitting by concern under `settings/` rather than one monolithic `settings.enc`
  is the same LWW-isolation move as tags/lists: a separately-written concern can
  later get its own `settings/<concern>.enc` so an unrelated settings edit on
  another device can't clobber it. Because the paths are fixed, **adding** a new
  `settings/<concern>.enc` needs no migration; renaming an existing one would.
- **Dangling ids are normal and must be tolerated.** Deleting `tags/{id}.enc`
  leaves bookmark metadata that still lists that id; a content file referenced by
  metadata may not be downloaded yet. In both cases the UI must **skip the
  unknown/absent reference and render the rest**, never error. No referential
  cleanup is required — LWW plus tolerant rendering covers it.
- **Metadata vs. content.** Metadata is small (`< ~2 KB`) and always synced into
  the local index; content/archives download **lazily, never on first sync**. The
  list-view fields (title, URL, tags, list, a truncated preview) live in metadata,
  so the **whole library is browsable and searchable offline** after first sync —
  only heavy media is deferred. Keep large fields (long descriptions, notes,
  thumbnails) **out of metadata** — store them as separate `files/{id}.enc`; never
  inline a thumbnail, or you blow the `< 2 KB` budget. Two lazy triggers:
  **viewport/scroll** fetches per-row media (thumbnail/screenshot) as rows come
  into view (prefetch slightly ahead); **open** fetches the full archived page.
  Each fetched blob is decrypted once and **cached in Dexie**, so re-views are
  instant and offline. The one tradeoff: a never-opened archive isn't available
  offline (see _deferred_ — offline pinning).
- **Plaintext typing: the namespace says what's inside, never the blob.** On the
  wire every object is the same opaque encrypted frame (see _crypto boundary —
  blob wire format_); nothing about an R2 object distinguishes JSON from an
  image. The decrypted bytes are typed by **convention baked into the client**:
  the index namespaces — `meta/`, `tags/`, `lists/`, `settings/` — are UTF-8
  JSON (decode, then `JSON.parse`), while `files/` is raw content whose meaning
  comes from the **metadata field that references it** — `pageArchive` means an
  HTML archive, a `screenshot`/`thumbnail` field means an image. The client only
  ever reaches a content blob _through_ such a field, so it knows what it is
  about to decrypt before it even signs the GET. Where one field may hold
  several formats (PNG vs. WebP, raw HTML vs. a single-file bundle), store the
  type beside the id **inside the metadata's ciphertext** — e.g.
  `"screenshot": { "id": "{id}.enc", "type": "image/webp" }` — a per-field
  metadata-schema decision that touches nothing in the sync engine, the blob
  frame, or the server. These plaintext JSON shapes are a **cross-platform
  contract** like the blob frame itself (every platform must read/write the
  same JSON), so their types/schemas belong in `@stxapps/shared`. The local
  store mirrors the agnosticism: the Dexie record holds path + `updatedAt` +
  raw decrypted bytes, and parsing into typed bookmark/tag/list entities is a
  read layer **above** sync.

### the three flows

**1. First sync (after sign-in).** Pull the full set of metadata/tag/list paths,
download + decrypt each, build the local index. Content/archives are _not_
downloaded here — they come on demand. For 5 000 bookmarks at ~500 bytes of
metadata each that's ~2.5 MB — manageable. Set the cursor to the **newest
`(updatedAt, path)` among the files listed** — the same reconstruction the
fallback full sync does from its listing.

**2. Incremental sync (next visit).** Call `GET /v1/ops/list` with the cursor,
get the ops whose `updatedAt` is newer than the cursor, apply them (download +
decrypt + store for `put`, remove for `delete`), and advance the cursor to the
**newest `updatedAt` in the response** (not the server's current newest — anything
that lands mid-sync simply carries a later `updatedAt` and is caught next time;
this is why the race in older drafts is a non-issue).

**3. Push (new / edited / deleted entity).** Write to the local store first and
enqueue the mutation in the pending-ops queue, then drain the queue:

```
create / edit a bookmark:  upload content files first, metadata file LAST
delete a bookmark:         delete metadata first, then content files
```

The commit protocol (3 round-trips), **batched** across files — `files/sign` and
`ops/commit` each take an array (up to 1000), so a multi-file create or a
first-sync push is a handful of round trips, not one per file:

1. `POST /v1/files/sign` with `{ op: 'put', paths: [...] }` to mint signed upload
   URL(s) (the Worker verifies each path is under `/users/{authedUid}/` and checks
   quota — see _authorization & quota_);
2. encrypt and PUT each blob directly to R2 via its signed URL;
3. `POST /v1/ops/commit` with `{ ops: [{ op, path }, …] }`; for each `put` the
   Worker **`HEAD`s the object** — which both confirms it exists in R2 and reads
   R2's authoritative `LastModified` — records the op with that timestamp (the DO's
   `commitOps`, which also stores R2's reported object size in the per-user quota
   map). The per-put HEADs fan out in parallel; one DO RPC then writes the whole
   batch. The Worker returns `{ results: [{ path, updatedAt }, …], failed: [{ path,
reason }, …] }` — `results` for the committed ops, `failed` for the refused ones.
   The `HEAD` does double duty: existence check _and_ the single clock that
   incremental and fallback both compare against.

A `put` whose R2 object is **missing** (its PUT never landed, or died before the
commit) is **not recorded — logging it would break the op-without-object
invariant** — and is reported in `failed` with `reason: 'no_object'`. So every op
the client sent gets an **explicit per-path outcome** (a path in neither `results`
nor `failed` is a server bug the client can detect), rather than inferring failure
from absence. On `no_object` the client re-PUTs + re-commits the gap next drain;
commit is idempotent, so a retry costs at most one redundant download. `reason` is
a typed enum so the deferred R2-conditional-write upgrade can add a `'stale'`
outcome (client action: re-_pull_ then retry — a different branch). A `delete`
always commits — and its R2 object is removed by the **Worker itself** at commit
(one bulk binding call per batch; `files/sign` mints only `put`/`get` URLs, so the
client never DELETEs R2 directly). R2 first, log last, the same direction as puts:
a commit that dies between the object delete and the log append leaves an absent
object with no op — invisible to incremental pull, healed by the fallback — and a
retried delete of an absent key is a no-op.

The pending-ops entry stays in the queue until its path appears in step 3's
`results` (a `failed` path stays queued for retry). **Crash recovery falls out of this for free:** if the client dies
between the R2 PUT and the commit, the entry is still queued; on retry it re-PUTs
(harmless — a fresh IV, but R2 PUTs are atomic so it just overwrites with
equivalent ciphertext) and commits. **Commit is idempotent in effect:**
re-committing a path appends another op row (the log isn't deduped on write), but
applying any op just means "re-download the latest version of that path," so a
duplicate costs one redundant download and nothing else — server-side op
coalescing (see _deferred_) trims the extra rows later. Never fail a commit on a
duplicate path.

The store records the **R2 `LastModified` returned by commit** as the file's
`updatedAt` and advances the sync cursor to it — never the local clock. Every `put`
is therefore stamped on R2's clock — the same value the client stores locally and
the fallback listing reads back — so there is no cross-device skew to reconcile
for any write that has a surviving object. (A `delete` op has no surviving object
to `HEAD`, so its `updated_at` is the **deletion commit time** — a `deletedAt` —
on the Worker's clock rather than R2's; the `updated_at` column thus mixes the two
clocks. That mismatch is harmless because paths are **immutable random ids**: a
path's life is only ever `put`…`put`…`delete`, never `delete`→`put`, so the two
clocks never have to order a put against a delete on the same path, and nothing
can be resurrected by skew. The one exception is deliberate: local-wins reconcile
re-`put`s a path whose `delete` another device already committed — keeping the
unsynced edit is the point — and that re-put's commit `HEAD` is stamped after the
delete in real time, so it orders after it up to Worker↔R2 clock skew.)

### the ops/list endpoint

The cursor is a **timestamp — R2's `LastModified`** — not a sequence number (see
_storage layout_ for why `seq` stays internal). Strictly it is the **compound key
`(updatedAt, path)`**, so the wire cursor is the pair `since` + `sincePath` (see
_Cursor precision & pagination_ below). The pull endpoint returns the ops newer
than the cursor plus the retained-range bounds, so the client can tell incremental
from fallback:

```
GET /v1/ops/list?since=2026-04-13T10:00:00.000Z&sincePath=meta/m_abc.enc&limit=500
→ {
    ops: [{ op, path, updatedAt }, ...],   // ordered by (updatedAt, path)
    oldestUpdatedAt,   // min updated_at still retained — null on an empty log
    newestUpdatedAt,   // max updated_at ever recorded — null on an empty log
    hasMore,
  }
```

`updatedAt` is R2's `LastModified` for a `put` (recorded via the commit `HEAD`)
and the deletion commit time for a `delete` (no surviving object — see _push_).
Both bounds are plain aggregates over the retained rows — `MIN(updated_at)` and
`MAX(updated_at)` — with **no high-water-mark table needed** (unlike a seq):
compaction trims oldest-first and never removes the newest row, so
`MAX(updated_at)` is always the true newest-ever. A never-written log reports
`oldestUpdatedAt = newestUpdatedAt = null`.

Routing:

| condition                                   | meaning                                                           | action                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `since` unset (never synced)                | new device / new account                                          | **first sync** (list R2; empty ⇒ nothing to do) |
| `since` set but bounds `null`               | cursor exists, log empty — wiped/reset beneath a returning client | **fallback** sync                               |
| `since > newestUpdatedAt`                   | cursor ahead of the log — log was reset                           | **fallback** sync                               |
| `since < oldestUpdatedAt`                   | ops before the cursor were compacted                              | **fallback** sync                               |
| `oldestUpdatedAt ≤ since ≤ newestUpdatedAt` | normal — run the keyset query                                     | apply `ops` (empty result ⇒ already up to date) |

What these rows encode — all because **an empty op log never means "no data";
only R2 can answer that** (the log is a disposable accelerator, rebuildable from
an R2 listing):

- **No cursor ⇒ first/full sync** (flow #1 — list R2), never the incremental
  path. So "nothing to do" is only reached after actually listing R2 and finding
  it empty — a wiped log can't be mistaken for a new account.
- **A cursor against `null` bounds ⇒ fallback.** A client with a cursor proves it
  synced before, so an empty log (both bounds `null`) means the log was wiped or
  reset under it — re-list R2 rather than reporting "up to date." This is the
  same wiped-log case as the row below, reached when compaction (or a rebuild)
  emptied the log entirely rather than just trimming past the cursor.
- **`oldestUpdatedAt ≤ since ≤ newestUpdatedAt` is inclusive at the top on
  purpose.** `since == newestUpdatedAt` is _not_ a separate "up to date" branch:
  because the cursor is the compound `(updatedAt, path)`, the newest millisecond
  can still hold ops with a higher `path` tiebreak the client hasn't seen. So the
  keyset query always runs at the boundary; an empty result is what means "already
  up to date," not the timestamp comparison.
- **`since > newestUpdatedAt` ⇒ fallback**, not "up to date." A healthy server's
  newest timestamp is always ≥ any cursor it issued (the client only stores
  cursors the server minted, and compaction never trims the newest), so a cursor
  ahead of it can't arise in steady state. It means the op log was reset, rebuilt,
  or restored from an older backup beneath a returning client — an infra event the
  disposable-log design _expects_, not necessarily a client bug. Either way,
  re-list R2.

**Cursor precision & pagination.** Because several files can share a millisecond,
the cursor is the compound key `(updatedAt, path)` and the pull is a **keyset**
scan: `WHERE (updated_at, path) > (since, sincePath)` ordered by
`(updated_at, path)`. Both halves go over the wire — the `since` _and_ `sincePath`
query params above — because without the `path` tiebreak a single millisecond
holding more than `limit` ops could never be paged past, and the
`since == newestUpdatedAt` boundary couldn't distinguish "consumed every op at
that ms" from "more remain with a higher path." A long-offline client pages
forward by advancing **both** params to the last op's `(updatedAt, path)` while
`hasMore` is true. (`sincePath` is omitted only while the cursor is still the
seeded-new-account `(0, '')`; the server treats a missing `sincePath` as the low
sentinel, so the scan includes every op at that millisecond.) This keyset query and the `oldestUpdatedAt` / `newestUpdatedAt`
bounds live in `op-logs.ts` (`listSince` keysets on `(updated_at, path)`;
`bounds()` returns `MIN`/`MAX(updated_at)`), surfaced to the route by the DO's
`listOps` RPC in `user-data.ts`. `seq` stays internal — it orders ties and drives
compaction, but never goes over the wire.

### a sync cycle: reconcile, then push, then pull

Flows 2 and 3 are building blocks; a live online session with local changes runs
both, and the order matters. **Reconcile first** — you can't safely push before
you know what the server changed, or you'd blind-overwrite a remote edit you never
saw.

1. **Pull the op list** (flow 2's request — metadata only: `{ op, path, updatedAt }`
   per changed path, _not_ the blobs).
2. **Reconcile** the pulled ops against the pending-ops queue, partitioning every
   touched path by who changed it. Each pending op carries the **base `updatedAt`**
   it was edited from (the path's stored server timestamp at edit time):
   - **server-only** (no pending op for the path) → **download**;
   - **local-only** (no server op for the path) → **upload**;
   - **both, server `updatedAt` == base** → the server didn't really change it
     (often your own earlier commit echoing back) → **upload** (clean
     fast-forward);
   - **both, server `updatedAt` > base** → a **true conflict**: both sides changed
     the file since your base. Resolve by the LWW policy (see _conflict policy_);
     the accepted outcome today is that one side's edit is dropped silently, and
     the deferred conditional-write upgrade turns this into a detected `412` +
     re-pull. _Which_ side wins — local (upload) vs server (download) — is an open
     product call (see _deferred_); **the shipped engine resolves local-wins**, so
     today every pending op lands in the upload set (which collapses the two
     "both" rows — the base comparison earns its keep when conditional writes
     land and `stale` needs the fast-forward/conflict distinction).
     The output is two **disjoint** sets: paths to upload, paths to download.
3. **Push** the upload set (flow 3 — meta-last; commit returns each new server
   `updatedAt`).
4. **Pull** the download set's blobs (decrypt, store; content stays lazy).
5. Advance the cursor to the newest `(updatedAt, path)` seen across the whole cycle —
   **including your own just-committed uploads**, so the next cycle doesn't
   re-fetch them.

Because step 2 resolves each conflicting path to exactly one side, the upload and
download sets never overlap — so steps 3 and 4 are order-independent and may run
concurrently; "push before pull" is just a sensible default (local changes durable
and visible first). A change another device commits _between_ the list pull and
your push is a TOCTOU window that degrades to the same accepted LWW overwrite until
conditional writes close it.

### fallback full sync (download-authoritative)

When routing lands on fallback (`since` older than `oldestUpdatedAt`, or ahead of
`newestUpdatedAt`), the op log can't reconstruct what changed, so the client
reconciles directly against R2. The fallback endpoint lists paths with their
`updatedAt` — which is **R2's own `LastModified`** (the timestamp R2 stamps on
every PUT, and the same value the client stores locally on each sync) — **one R2
page per call**:

```
GET /v1/files/list?limit=1000
→ {
    files: [ { path: "meta/m_abc.enc", updatedAt: 1744538400000 }, ... ],
    nextPageToken: "…" | null,   // R2's opaque list cursor; null when complete
  }
```

The whole namespace can be thousands of objects, and each R2 `list()` is one
subrequest capped at 1000 keys, so the listing is paged: the client passes
`nextPageToken` back as `pageToken` and **loops until it comes back null**.
`pageToken` is **opaque** — it's R2's own list cursor relayed straight through, not
a path or a keyset on `(updatedAt, path)` like `ops/list` (that endpoint queries
the DO's SQLite, where we own the ordering; this one rides R2's native cursor over
a listing we don't control — R2 lists in key order, not time order). Two
consequences: the client **can't stop early** (the newest `updatedAt` can sit on
any page, since key order ≠ time order — see the cursor note below), and the
listing is **not a snapshot** (pages span concurrent writes). The non-snapshot is
safe here precisely because fallback is download-authoritative and
`updatedAt`-compared: anything that changes mid-listing carries a fresh
`LastModified` and is simply caught on the next sync.

Using R2's own clock — not a separately-minted timestamp — is what lets fallback
recover a _commit-died edit_ (`object-without-op`, case B): the new bytes carry a
fresh `LastModified` in R2 even though no op was ever recorded, so the comparison
below still sees the server copy as newer and re-downloads it.

The fallback is **download-authoritative**: the server list is treated as truth
for every path **without** a pending local op, so a server-side deletion is never
resurrected and a stale leftover is dropped. A path **with** a pending op is a
genuine unsynced local intent, and it resolves exactly as the incremental cycle
resolves it — **local-wins** — so a fallback (an infra event: log wiped,
compacted, reset) never silently flips a conflict to server-wins, clobbers a
queued edit, or resurrects a bookmark whose delete is still queued:

| local vs. server                                     | action                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| on server, no pending op, newer `updatedAt` (or new) | **download**                                      |
| pending op for the path (`put` or `delete`)          | **push** — local-wins, same policy as incremental |
| pending `delete`, object already gone server-side    | **push anyway** — idempotent; see below           |
| local only, **not** in pending-ops queue             | **delete locally** — it was deleted server-side   |
| on server, no pending op, equal `updatedAt`          | skip                                              |

The local-only row is what kills the deleted-bookmark-resurrection bug, and it
needs no user prompt. The comparison uses the **stored server `updatedAt`**,
never Dexie's local write time.

The already-gone `delete` is still pushed because the absence is ambiguous:
usually another device committed the delete (so the re-commit costs one
redundant op row), but it can also be **this device's own commit that crashed**
between the R2 object delete and the DO write — and then the retried commit is
the only thing that ever logs the op (so incremental pullers learn of the
deletion) and frees the path's recorded size from the quota map. Commit is
idempotent on both stores (deleting an absent key is a no-op; freeing an
unrecorded path frees 0), so pushing unconditionally is always safe — dropping
the op instead would leak the `file_sizes` entry forever (paths are never
reused, so no later commit would ever touch it).

After reconciling, set the cursor to the **newest `(updatedAt, path)` among the
listed files — taken across _all_ pages**, not just the last one (R2 returns key order,
not time order, so the newest timestamp can land on any page) — reconstructed
straight from R2, with no dependence on the op log, so the next visit resumes
normal incremental sync. In the `since > newestUpdatedAt`
case this lowers the cursor _below_ the stale value it had: R2 is the source of
truth, the old cursor pointed past what exists, so it's reset down to reality.
This is the resume a `seq` cursor couldn't give you: there is no sequence number
to recover from an R2 listing, but the newest `LastModified` always is one. (A delete that happened _after_ that
newest surviving timestamp leaves no object to carry it, but it was already
reconciled by the download-authoritative pass above, so the cursor needn't
account for it.)

### multi-file consistency & orphans

A bookmark spans 2–3 files (metadata + content + archive). Consistency comes from
two cheap rules, not transactions:

- **upload metadata LAST, delete metadata FIRST.** The metadata file is what
  makes a bookmark "exist," so a half-finished create leaves only orphaned
  content (harmless) and a half-finished delete leaves only orphaned content
  (harmless) — never metadata pointing at a missing file in a way the UI can't
  absorb (and it absorbs dangling ids anyway).
- **R2 object PUTs are atomic**, so even an in-place content _update_ never
  yields a torn read: a reader gets the whole old object or the whole new one.
  This is why immutable/versioned content files are **not** needed — meta-last /
  meta-first plus atomic PUT fully cover multi-file consistency.

**Orphans can't be garbage-collected server-side** — the server can't read the
ciphertext to know what's referenced. The only place GC is possible is the
**client**, which holds the key, can decrypt all metadata to compute the
referenced set, and delete the rest. We don't do this yet; the per-user quota
bounds the growth, and orphans are produced only by rare mid-flight failures.

### who enforces ordering: server per-commit, client cross-commit

Two **independent** ordering constraints keep the system consistent, and they
live in two different places **because of what each side can observe and
control** — the split is forced, not stylistic.

- **A — R2 ↔ op-log, _within_ one commit.** The R2 mutation must land before the
  DO log write: a `put` is `HEAD`-verified to exist before its op is logged, a
  `delete` removes the R2 object before logging the delete. This is the
  `op-without-object` invariant (see _source of truth_), and **only the server
  can own it** — the client can't write the op-log at all, and can't DELETE R2
  directly (`files/sign` mints only PUT/GET). Both halves happen inside
  `commitOps` (`services/sync.ts`): `deleteMany` R2 → `HEAD` puts → one DO
  `commitOps` last. The DO write is the atomic point, so a puller sees an op only
  once its object is real.

- **B — metadata ↔ content, _across_ commits.** The global phase order
  `[delete-metadata, delete-content, put-content, put-metadata]` (the meta-last /
  meta-first rules above, generalized across chunk and commit boundaries), so a
  metadata object never references a missing content object across any crash
  boundary. This is a property of the **sequence** of commits, and **only the
  client can own it**, for three reasons the server can't get around:
  1. **No referential knowledge.** Content is opaque (E2E). The server sees
     `meta/{id}` and `files/{id}` as unrelated paths; it can confirm _an object_
     exists (that's A), never that _the content this metadata points at_ exists —
     it can't read the reference graph, and a note may reference zero or many
     content files.
  2. **It sees one batch, not the order.** Each commit is handled in isolation
     with no memory of phase; the phase order lives in the client's pending queue.
  3. **It isn't in the upload path.** Content is PUT client→R2 over a presigned
     URL out of band; the server only learns of it at commit-time `HEAD`.

A is the **primitive B is built on**: because every commit is R2-first/log-last
and the DO write is atomic, each phase is durable as a unit before the next
begins. That durability is exactly what lets the engine sequence the four phases
and trust each is real before opening the next. The engine realizes B in
`pushPending` (`brace-web/src/sync/engine.ts`), and two things there are
**load-bearing for correctness**, not just tidiness:

- **sequential `await` between phases** — the durability-before-next-phase
  guarantee _is_ this ordering; and
- **single-flight per account** (`inflightSyncs`) — two concurrent drains would
  interleave phases and break the global order.

Neither constraint can be moved to the other side. Pushing B server-side would
require exposing the reference graph to the server (weakening E2E opacity) and
**still** wouldn't buy atomicity — R2 has no multi-object transaction and the
uploads are out of band — so the crash windows would remain. The current
placement (A = server/per-commit, B = client/cross-commit) is the minimal correct
arrangement.

### conflict policy

File-level **last-writer-wins**, which is cheap because granularity is one entity
per file. Accepted tradeoff, written down so it isn't a surprise:

> Two devices editing the **same** file concurrently → the later PUT wins and the
> earlier edit is lost silently.

For a single-user, multi-device manager this is acceptable. The cheap future
upgrade is **R2 conditional writes** (`If-Match` on the etag, or `If-None-Match:
*` for create) baked into the presigned URL, so a stale write `412`s and the
client re-pulls before retrying. Deferred, not designed away.

### crypto boundary & what the server still learns

Every blob is AES-256-GCM under the single data key derived from the account DEK
(see [account.md](./account.md)); `@stxapps/web-crypto`'s `encrypt` uses a
**fresh random 96-bit IV per call**, so one key for all files is safe. Door
changes / password changes re-wrap only the 32-byte DEK and **never re-encrypt
data**, so the sync layer is entirely oblivious to them.

**Blob wire format.** Every R2 object is the binary frame
`[version(1) || iv(12) || ciphertext+tag]` — packed/unpacked by the sync
engine's crypto boundary (`sync/crypto.ts` in brace-web). The constants
(`BLOB_FORMAT_V1`, `AES_GCM_IV_BYTES`) live in `@stxapps/shared`
(`crypto/params.ts`) because they are a **cross-platform contract** like the
key-derivation parameters: a blob packed on web must unpack on the extension
and the future Expo client, forever. Raw bytes, deliberately not a JSON
envelope — base64 would inflate every blob ~33% (worst on the heavy content
files that count against the quota), and any plaintext field beside the
ciphertext (a content type, say) would leak to the server. What a blob
_contains_ (text vs. image, archive vs. thumbnail) is described **inside the
ciphertext** of the metadata that references it, never in the frame. The
version byte is format-change insurance: a future layout (new cipher, different
IV size, compression) mints a new version constant and a new decode branch, so
old blobs keep decoding side by side instead of forcing a download-and-re-encrypt
migration; readers reject an unknown version loudly. The IV is 12 bytes because
96 bits is the recommended GCM size (other lengths take a weaker GHASH path) —
it would only ever change as part of a new versioned format.

Even with E2E, the server still learns the **number of files, each file's size,
its timestamps, and access patterns** (which blobs are fetched when). It does
**not** learn titles, URLs, tag/list names, or the metadata→content reference
graph (all inside the ciphertext). Keeping metadata uniformly small (`< ~2 KB`)
blunts size correlation. Acceptable for a bookmark manager — named here so it's a
decision, not an accident.

### authorization & quota

Because the server can't inspect contents, it must enforce policy on the
**envelope**:

- the wire carries each path **relative to the user's root** (`meta/{id}.enc`, …),
  never the `/users/{uid}/` prefix. On **every** `POST /v1/files/sign` (and every
  `ops/*` / `files/*` call) the Worker derives the `/users/{authedUid}/` prefix
  from the session and prepends it (`lib/r2-keys.ts`), so a path can only ever
  resolve under the **caller's** namespace — one user **cannot** name another's
  object. The contract (`syncPathSchema` in `@stxapps/shared`) additionally pins
  the shape to a known namespace, so there's no separator or traversal sequence to
  smuggle a key outside it;
- on `op: 'put'`, additionally enforce a **per-user file-count and byte quota** at
  issuance — the only place abuse can be bounded when content is opaque. `op: 'get'`
  needs no quota (reading your own data), so download URLs can be **minted in
  batch** for a fast first sync without per-blob round-trips.

The byte total backing that quota is **not** summed from the op log — the log is
compactable and disposable, so it would undercount. It comes from a separate,
durable **per-path size map** — the `file_sizes` table in the same per-user DO
(`do/repositories/file-sizes.ts`): `path → size`, set from the commit `HEAD` on
`put`, read-and-subtracted on `delete` (a delete has no object left to `HEAD`, so
the size to free must already be recorded). That map, not the op log, is where size
is persisted; the op-log row is just `{ seq, op, path, updated_at }`. The limits
themselves live in `lib/quota.ts`, checked by `services/sync.ts` against the DO's
`usage()` before any `put` URL is minted.

### where TanStack Query fits

The dividing line is **React-component calls vs. the background sync engine**,
not Hono-vs-R2.

**Use it for component-facing API endpoints.** Auth (username check, sign-in,
create-account, session), account settings, a sync-status read — these go through
TanStack Query (`useQuery`/`useMutation`) for uniform loading/error/retry/dedup
state and devtools. Those hooks live in `@stxapps/react` and **wrap
`callEndpoint`**, so the shared contract stays the single source of truth and the
hooks stay reusable on brace-extension and (future) brace-expo.

**Don't use it for the local-first data path.** The Dexie `liveQuery` store is
already the read cache for bookmarks — adding TanStack Query there just creates a
second, competing cache — and the sync engine runs at background/app level, not
in React, so hooks don't apply. Its control-plane calls (sync pull, commit,
signed URLs) and the R2 blob PUT/GET use plain `callEndpoint`/`fetch`; results
land in Dexie, which the UI observes reactively.

In short: **component server calls → TanStack Query; background sync engine + R2
→ plain `callEndpoint`.** Both call the same `@stxapps/shared` contracts.

### deferred

- **R2 conditional writes** for same-file concurrent-edit detection (see
  _conflict policy_) — accepted as LWW for now.
- **True-conflict winner: local-wins vs server-wins** (see _a sync cycle_) — when
  reconcile finds both sides changed a path since the base, local-wins (upload)
  clobbers the other device's committed edit; server-wins (download) discards the
  user's unsynced edit. Open product call (the shipped engine picks local-wins —
  never silently discard the user's unsynced work); conditional writes make it a
  prompt rather than a silent choice.
- **Client-side orphan GC** (see _multi-file consistency_) — quota bounds growth
  until then.
- **Offline content pinning / prefetch** (see _data model — metadata vs.
  content_) — let users mark bookmarks "available offline," or prefetch archives
  on idle, so a never-opened archive isn't missing offline.
- **Local content-cache eviction** — lazily fetched content/archive blobs
  accumulate in Dexie against the IndexedDB budget; an LRU eviction of _content_
  (metadata is never evicted) keeps it bounded. Distinct from server-side orphan
  GC above.
- **Op-log compaction alarm** — the DO's `alarm()` is the natural driver; see the
  class comment in `user-data.ts`.
- **Manual "repair sync" control** — a user-facing button that forces the
  download-authoritative fallback (see _fallback full sync_) on demand, for the
  rare case where incremental sync is missing data — e.g. an `object-without-op`
  left by a device that never returned to commit. The mechanism already exists;
  this just exposes a trigger, and doubles as a first-line support tool.
- **Server-side op coalescing** — when a path has several ops since the client's
  cursor, return only the latest (a `put` collapses earlier `put`s; a `delete`
  collapses everything prior for that path). Efficiency only, not correctness: the
  client already collapses by path when it partitions in _a sync cycle_, so it
  never double-downloads — this just trims op-list payload and pagination
  round-trips, and mainly for the _medium gap_ (far enough behind to have
  duplicate paths, not far enough to hit fallback). Trades the cheap
  `updated_at > ? LIMIT` scan for a heavier `GROUP BY path` query that interacts
  with the `(updatedAt, path)` keyset, so measure before adding. Distinct from the
  retention-trimming op-log compaction above.
