## locks

The device-local **app lock** and **list locks** — a password gate the user can
put over the whole app or over an individual list (and its subtree). This doc is
the home for the feature that was previously explained only in code comments
(the two `lock-provider.tsx` headers, `LockRecord` in each app's `db.ts`, and
`computeCoverage`); other docs reference it in passing —
[business-model.md](./business-model.md) (the `locks` Plus entitlement),
[editors.md](./editors.md) (why the pickers ignore hidden lists),
[account.md](./account.md) (the E2E substrate this sits _over_).

Both client apps implement it symmetrically: the web stack in
`@stxapps/web-react` (brace-web, brace-extension) and the Expo stack in
`@stxapps/expo-react` (brace-expo). The shared, platform-agnostic pieces — the
coverage math and the verifier parameters — live in `@stxapps/shared` /
`@stxapps/{web,expo}-crypto` so the two can't drift.

### what it is — and, crucially, what it is not

A lock is a **shoulder-surfing deterrent, not encryption.** The security
substrate is the account's end-to-end encryption, which is **free for everyone**
(see [account.md](./account.md)); a lock is the convenience layer _over_
already-decrypted data — the plaintext links sit in IndexedDB (web) or
expo-sqlite + expo-file-system (native) one table over from the verifier. So:

- **The threat it addresses** is a borrowed/unattended _unlocked_ device — a
  friend scrolling your phone, someone glancing at your open laptop. It hides
  content behind a quick password; it does not defend against an adversary with
  the device and technical skill, who can read the decrypted rows directly.
- **This is why charging for it isn't charging for privacy** (business-model.md,
  _locks are the wedge lever_): E2E — the actual privacy guarantee — stays free;
  only the convenience gate is a Plus lever.

Everything below follows from that framing. Because a lock guards decrypted
data, the design optimizes for _feel_ (instant unlock) and _breadth of the gate_
(cover the whole subtree, exclude from every read path) rather than for
cryptographic strength it structurally can't provide.

### the verifier — `@stxapps/{web,expo}-crypto` `lock-verifier.ts`

A lock stores a **one-way verifier pair**, never the password:

- `createLockVerifier(password)` → `{ salt, hash }` (both hex): random 16-byte
  salt, **PBKDF2-SHA256 at 600 000 iterations** (OWASP's current recommendation),
  32-byte output.
- `verifyLockPassword(password, verifier)` re-derives and constant-time-compares.

Two deliberate choices:

- **PBKDF2, not the account's Argon2id.** A memory-hard KDF buys no real
  protection over already-decrypted data, and unlocking should feel _instant_
  (~100–300 ms) rather than cost the sign-in's ~1–3 s. Web runs
  `crypto.subtle.deriveBits` (non-blocking, no worker); native runs
  quick-crypto's callback-form `pbkdf2` (C++ `fastpbkdf2`, off the JS thread).
- **Store a hash, not the old reversibly-encrypted password.** The recovery path
  is identical (sign out) and a one-way hash is strictly better.

The verifier is **hex**, per the `@stxapps/shared` `crypto/encoding.ts`
convention (short binary crypto material is hex; base64 is for size-sensitive
payloads like images). Verifiers are device-local and never synced, so unlike
the account pipeline there is **no cross-platform byte contract** to pin — the
two `lock-verifier.ts` files just mirror the same parameters and encoding so they
read as one.

### storage — the `locks` table

One `LockRecord` per lock, in a device-local `locks` table
(`data/lock-store.ts` in each app):

```ts
interface LockRecord {
  id: string; // 'app' (APP_LOCK_ID) for the app lock, else the locked list's id
  kind: 'app' | 'list';
  salt: string; // hex verifier pair
  hash: string;
  hideList?: boolean; // list locks only — see "hide" below
}
```

- **Keying.** The app lock is the single constant row `APP_LOCK_ID = 'app'`. List
  locks are keyed by their **list id** (stable across renames; a system-list
  constant or a random token — neither collides with `'app'`).
- **Same shape on both platforms**, deliberately, so `@stxapps/shared`'s
  `computeCoverage` sees one type. (The expo store maps drizzle's `null` ⇄
  `undefined` for `hideList` at the boundary so the in-memory shape matches web's
  optional field.)
- **Never synced; wiped on sign-out** (`clearData`) — which _is_ the
  forgot-a-password recovery path.
- **Native uses expo-sqlite, NOT expo-secure-store — on purpose.** A verifier is
  a one-way pair guarding already-decrypted data, so it needs a _queryable_
  device-local table, not credential storage. secure-store also fights the shape:
  no key enumeration, a ~2 KB per-entry Android cap that N list locks would
  breach, and iOS-Keychain survival across uninstall that plain app data
  correctly lacks.

`lock-store.ts` is pure read/write (no network, no React). Reactivity and the
in-memory unlocked state are the provider's job.

### coverage — `@stxapps/shared` `sync/lock-coverage.ts`

A lock on a list **covers its whole subtree.** Otherwise Show All / tag views /
search would leak the children's links and the lock would be decorative. The
coverage walk is a **pure function** (`computeCoverage`), split out of the
providers so it's unit-testable without React or a store and **shared by both
platforms** so the semantics can't drift (`lock-coverage.spec`).

Given the list tree, the lock rows, and the set of currently-unlocked ids, it
resolves per list:

- **`lockedListIds`** — every list whose links are gated (covered by a locked
  lock, **descendants included**).
- **`hiddenListIds`** — the covered lists that should also disappear from the
  sidebar and pickers (the subset whose covering lock — or a locked ancestor —
  set `hideList`).
- **`coveringLockIds`** — covered list id → the **nearest locked self-or-ancestor**
  lock row. This is the lock a password prompt for that list verifies against.

The walk carries the nearest locked ancestor's lock id down the tree: an
**ancestor lock wins** as the covering lock (you must open the outermost door
first; an inner lock takes over on the recompute _after_ that unlock). `hideList`
propagates from any locked ancestor, and a list's own locked `hideList` applies
even under a non-hiding ancestor lock.

### unlocked state is in-memory only — the load-bearing invariant

The one thing the store deliberately does **not** persist is _which locks are
currently open._ The provider holds `unlockedIds` as plain in-memory React state
(`markUnlocked` / `markLocked`). Consequences, all intended:

- **Every lock re-engages on reload (web) / relaunch (expo) by construction** —
  there is no "stay unlocked" persistence to get wrong.
- Verification reads the row **fresh from the store** (not the live-query
  snapshot) so a just-written lock is always verifiable.
- `unlockList` tries the list's **own** row first, then its **covering** lock, so
  one password opens whichever it belongs to (settings' per-row "Unlock…" matches
  the row it names; the main pane's prompt opens the outer door).

**brace-expo strengthens this with auto-relock (expo-only).** Web relies on
tab-close to re-engage locks — a naturally short session. A mobile process keeps
`unlockedIds` in memory across backgrounding, so an unlocked, backgrounded phone
handed to someone would stay open. So the expo `lock-provider` runs the
**"time-based + app-state" rule as one mechanism**: it stamps the time on the
`AppState` `background` transition, and on the next `active` transition drops
**every** session unlock if the app was away longer than a grace window
(`AUTO_RELOCK_AFTER_MS`, 60 s). It's keyed off the `background` transition (not
the transient iOS `inactive`) and gated on elapsed time on purpose — so Control
Center, the biometric/permission sheet, a call, or a 2-second app-switch never
force a re-unlock, while a genuinely-away device relocks. This is a **justified
platform divergence** (web has no auto-relock), and it _strengthens_ the
in-memory-unlock invariant rather than contradicting it. Natural companion, not
yet built: **biometric unlock** — aggressive auto-relock is only pleasant when
re-entry is a glance, not a password (business-model.md names "biometric
quick-lock" as the convenience layer).

### the two enforcement edges

Coverage feeds exactly two places. Everything else about locks is chrome.

**1. `lockedListIds` → the link query's `lists.none` (the read edge).** In
`use-links`, the covered ids fold into the query's exclusion so **every read
path — browse, Show All, tags, search, pins — drops the covered links
uniformly.** This is _enforcement_: no query can opt out (unlike Trash, which a
`?list-any=trash` view can opt into). The grammar-level shaping lives in
`excludeLists`, which preserves the read's fast path — a positive list view (My
List, a user list) keeps its exact-count fast path because the suppressed ids
aren't in its `any`; Show All and tag/search views pay a `lists.none` clause.

On top of that, a **locked _selected_ list swaps the whole main-pane body** for
the unlock pane (`LockPane`) **before the data hook mounts** — the web
`ListLockPane` component / the inline swap in brace-expo's `main.tsx`, with
`UnlockedMain` kept separate precisely so `useLinks` never runs while locked. The
locked list's links are then never fetched, never in the DOM (find-in-page,
screen readers). Deep links that merely _include_ a locked list (`?list-any=…`,
tags, search) don't swap — their queries exclude the locked links instead.

**2. `hiddenListIds` → sidebar/picker pruning (navigation only).** The covered
lists whose lock hides them are pruned from the sidebar tree — a pure declutter.
The link editors' list pickers deliberately **do NOT** prune these (see
[editors.md](./editors.md)): hiding a list never blocks _filing_ a link into a
list you know exists, and the pickers must stay consistent with the browser
extension, which — locks being device-local — can't know a web device's hidden
lists anyway. So: **a lock gates a list's contents; hide only tidies the sidebar;
neither touches the pickers.** (`buildShareLists` filters only Trash and never
reads locks.)

### mutations, relock, and the entitlement gate

The provider exposes:

- **Set up** — `setAppLock` / `addListLock(id, pw, { hideList })`: create a
  verifier, write the row. `setAppLock` marks the app **unlocked** for this
  session (enabling from settings must not slam the gate shut on the spot; it
  engages next load). `addListLock` marks the list **locked** — "Lock" means lock
  _now_, dropping any stale unlock for that id.
- **Remove** — `removeAppLock` / `removeListLock`: verify, then delete; `false` =
  wrong password.
- **Unlock** — `unlockApp` / `unlockList`: verify, mark unlocked; `true` opens it.
- **Relock** — `lockApp` / `lockList`: drop this session's unlock so the gate
  closes **without a reload/relaunch**. No password (relocking is free), no store
  write. These live on the `Locks` interface **beside their inverses**
  (`unlock*`), as session interaction — not on `LockMutations`, which is the
  persisted-write surface.

**Entitlement.** `locks` is a **Plus** lever (business-model.md). It's gated **at
the affordance**, before any password dialog opens, so a free user never types a
secret into a form that can't submit. **Unlock and remove stay open even for a
downgraded (ex-Plus) account**, so an existing lock is never stranded.

### biometric unlock (expo-only)

Face ID / Touch ID as a **fast-path over the password**, on brace-expo only (web
has no equivalent; native biometry via `expo-local-authentication`). The design
turns on one decision:

**Biometric is a boolean gate, not a released secret.** Since a lock guards
already-decrypted data and derives no key, biometric success just flips the same
in-memory unlock a password would — **nothing is stored behind the biometry.**
The alternative (stash the password in a biometric-gated Keychain item, release
and verify it) would materialize a plaintext password at rest that the design
avoids, for zero gain: its usual advantage — the OS cryptographically gates the
secret so a hooked `authenticateAsync` on a rooted device can't bypass it — is
moot here, because an attacker who can hook LocalAuthentication on a rooted device
can already read the decrypted SQLite/files directly. So the boolean gate's trust
boundary exactly matches the feature's, with no secret at rest.

Consequences, all deliberate:

- **The password is always the root credential; biometric is opt-in on top.**
  There is no biometric-only lock — biometry is unreliable (bad read, re-enroll,
  the iOS "5 fails → passcode" lockout), and with no knowledge-factor fallback the
  only recovery would be sign-out (wiping every lock). So a lock is _always_
  created with a password; `biometric` is a per-lock opt-in flag layered over it.
- **Disabling biometric never unlocks.** It just clears the flag; the password
  lock stays and stays engaged. "Disable Face ID" (free toggle) and "Remove lock"
  (password-gated, actually unlocks + clears) are distinct — the clean split is
  only possible _because_ the password always exists.
- **`disableDeviceFallback: true`.** The fallback for a brace lock is the app's
  own password field, never the device passcode (a different factor — letting it
  through would let anyone with the phone PIN open every lock).

**Storage & API.** An expo-only `biometric?: boolean` on the `locks` row (beside
`hideList`; the shared `CoverageLock` slice ignores it, so `computeCoverage` is
untouched). The provider probes the device once (`getBiometricCapability` →
`biometricAvailable` + a `biometricLabel` like "Face ID"), and exposes
`unlockAppWithBiometric` / `unlockListWithBiometric` (OS prompt → the same
`markUnlocked` path; the list variant resolves the covering lock like
`unlockList`) plus `setAppBiometric` / `setListBiometric` (enabling runs one OS
confirm first, so a lock never promises biometry the device can't deliver). The
thin `expo-local-authentication` wrapper is `expo-react` `lib/biometric.ts`.

**Where it surfaces.** The `LockPane` (app gate + locked-list pane)
**auto-prompts once on mount** when the gating lock has opted in, with a "Unlock
with {label}" button and the password field as the ever-present fallback; a
cancel drops to the password, never loops. Enable/disable lives in Settings — a
Switch in Misc (app lock) and an "Enable/Disable {label}" item in the Lists row
kebab (per list). Toggling it needs no entitlement (creating the lock was the
paywalled step). This is what makes the 60 s auto-relock pleasant — re-entry is a
glance, not a password. Native module → `expo prebuild` + a real device with
enrolled biometry to exercise; jest/Metro can't drive the prompt.

### UI surfaces

| Surface                                                | Web                                | Expo                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Set/remove **app lock**                                | Settings → Misc                    | Settings → Misc                       |
| Lock/unlock/remove **list lock** (+ `hideList` opt-in) | Settings → Lists (row kebab)       | Settings → Lists (row kebab)          |
| **Relock a list** ("Lock now")                         | Sidebar row — hover/focus-revealed | Sidebar row — always shown (no hover) |
| **Relock the app** ("Lock app")                        | Topbar overflow menu               | Topbar overflow menu                  |
| **Unlock a browsed list**                              | Main-pane `LockPane` swap          | Main-pane `LockPane` swap             |
| **App lock screen**                                    | `AppLockGate` (content swap)       | `AppLockGate` (content swap)          |
| **Biometric unlock** (Face ID / Touch ID)              | —                                  | `LockPane` auto-prompt + button       |
| **Enable/disable biometric**                           | —                                  | Misc (Switch) / Lists row kebab       |

The relock affordances split by scope on purpose: a list relock is contextual, so
it lives on the row; the app lock isn't a list, so its relock lives in the
app-global overflow menu, not the rail. The password dialog behind every _edit_
is one shared `LockPasswordDialog`; the _unlock_ surfaces users hit while
browsing are the in-place `LockPane`, not that dialog.

`AppLockGate` is a **content swap, not a redirect**, mounted above
`InitialSyncGate` so the lock screen is the first thing shown and the first sync
proceeds behind it. Its `'checking'` phase (the first locks read) renders
**nothing** — the same no-flash guarantee as the sync gate: a device with no app
lock must never flash a lock screen, and a locked one must never flash the app.

### web / expo parity

The providers are mirrored; the shared coverage math and verifier parameters keep
them honest. The divergences are all platform-shaped:

|                       | web (`web-react`)        | expo (`expo-react`)                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Store                 | Dexie `locks` table      | expo-sqlite + drizzle                    |
| Reactivity            | `useLiveQuery`           | drizzle `useLiveQuery` (change listener) |
| Verifier crypto       | Web Crypto `subtle`      | `react-native-quick-crypto`              |
| Locked-list pane      | `ListLockPane` component | inlined in `main.tsx`                    |
| "Lock now" affordance | hover-revealed           | always shown                             |
| Auto-relock           | — (tab-close relocks)    | background-elapsed (`AppState`)          |
| Biometric unlock      | —                        | `expo-local-authentication`              |

One shared subtlety in both: an **orphan sweep.** List deletion _syncs_ from
other devices while locks are device-local, so a lock can outlive its list. Both
providers sweep orphaned list-lock rows — guarded to a ready store with a
resolved, non-empty tree (an empty tree means "still loading", and sweeping then
would wrongly drop every list lock).

### where the code lives

- **Shared:** `@stxapps/shared` `sync/lock-coverage.ts` (`computeCoverage`).
- **Verifier:** `@stxapps/web-crypto` and `@stxapps/expo-crypto`
  `lib/lock-verifier.ts`.
- **Provider + store:** `contexts/lock-provider.tsx`, `data/lock-store.ts`, and
  the `LockRecord`/`locks` table in `data/db.ts` — in both `web-react` and
  `expo-react`.
- **Read-edge fold:** each app's `use-links` (`lockedListIds` → `excludeLists`).
- **UI:** the settings Misc/Lists sections, the links sidebar + overflow menu,
  `app-lock-gate.tsx`, `lock-password-dialog.tsx`, `lock-pane.tsx`, and (web)
  `list-lock-pane.tsx`.
- **Biometric (expo-only):** `expo-react` `lib/biometric.ts` +
  `expo-local-authentication` (config plugin in `app.json`); the `biometric`
  column in expo's `data/db.ts` / `lock-store.ts`.
