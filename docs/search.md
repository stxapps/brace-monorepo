## links search

How the links page turns a URL into a filtered, ordered view — the **write/route
layer** of search. This doc owns the `URL ⇄ LinkQuery` grammar, the two writers
(`setSimpleQuery` / `setQuery`), and why `selection` is a derived projection of the
query. It deliberately does **not** re-document two things that already have homes:
how a query is **evaluated** against the store (drivers, the extraction join,
non-exact totals) lives in [client-queries.md](./client-queries.md) — the read edge;
and **which rungs cost money** (basic free, advanced Plus, saved Pro) lives in
[business-model.md](./business-model.md) — "search is a three-rung ladder". This doc
is the connective tissue between them.

Code: `app/(app)/links/_contexts/page-provider.tsx` (the grammar + writers +
projection), `app/(app)/links/_components/search-bar.tsx` (the UI), and
`packages/web-react/src/data/queries.ts` (`LinkQuery`, the read engine).

### the query is the URL

The **URL is the single source of truth**. Both the full filter (`query: LinkQuery`)
and the single-axis view state (`selection`) are **derived** from it — never stored
separately — so search survives reload, the back button steps through views, and
every view is deep-linkable. The param value is always an **opaque id** (a system
constant or a random entity token) or a plain search word; never a plaintext list/tag
name, which stays encrypted in the local store. That's what keeps the URL
zero-knowledge.

`parseLinkQuery` maps the URL onto the grammar. Each filterable field carries its
relation in the param **name**:

```
list / list-any / list-none            (a link is in one list: no `all`)
tag  / tag-any  / tag-all  / tag-none
text / text-all / text-any / text-none (words over the COMBINED url⊕title)
url  / url-all  / url-any  / url-none   (substring words, url only)
title/ title-all/ title-any/ title-none
sort = created | updated               (ordering, default updated)
```

- The **bare name is sugar** for the common relation: `list`/`tag` → `any` (include
  any of), `text`/`url`/`title` → `all` (must contain every word). Clauses **AND
  across fields** (a link must satisfy every non-empty one); cross-field OR is
  intentionally not expressible — see _deferred_ below.
- Values are **repeated keys** (`?tag=a&tag=b`, `?text=foo&text=bar`), never `+`
  (decodes to space) or comma (breaks on ids containing one). A multi-word search box
  therefore splits on whitespace into repeated keys, each an AND term.
- Two derivations bake into the parse: `?list=all` (`ALL_ID`) is **dropped** from the
  lists clause (Show All is the absence of a list filter, not a filter), and a URL
  with **no filter params at all** injects the default inbox (`lists.any =
[My List]`). This injection is load-bearing for the projection below.

**`text` is the basic rung; `url`/`title` are the advanced rungs.** `text` matches
its words against the **combined `url ⊕ title` haystack** (host lives inside url), so
a word may land in either field — one clause, one box, "search words, all links".
`url`/`title` are the field-scoped counterparts. All three AND together and with
lists/tags like any other clause. How `text` is actually evaluated (it carries the
title half, so — like a `title` clause — it forces the link↔extraction join and drops
the exact count) is a read-engine concern: see
[client-queries.md](./client-queries.md) and `needsExtractionJoin` in `queries.ts`.

### two writers, not a mirror

The read direction is **many→one and lossy** (many URLs collapse onto one
`selection`), so it pays to derive `selection` once and let consumers read it. The
**write** direction is the opposite: nobody ever wants to "write a whole `LinkQuery`"
— the intents are small and specific. So there are two writers, shaped by intent, not
a single symmetric `setQuery`:

- **`setSimpleQuery(selection)`** — navigation. Commits a _simple_ query (one
  list/tag/all axis) as the **canonical clean URL** (`hrefForSelection`: `/links`,
  `?list=all`, `?tag=x`). The sidebar's writer — it shouldn't have to assemble a full
  `LinkQuery` with empty clauses just to say "list X". (Renamed from `setSelection`:
  it writes a _query_; `selection` is what you read back, never what you set.)
- **`setQuery(query)`** — the full grammar. Serializes an arbitrary `LinkQuery` back
  to the URL (`hrefForQuery`, the inverse of `parseLinkQuery` — bare relations for the
  common case, suffixed forms for the rest, repeated keys). The **search editor's**
  writer.

Both write the URL; both let `query`/`selection` re-derive from it. The asymmetry is
why there's no single wide `setQuery(LinkQuery)` for navigation: a full inverse
serializer is only justified once a writer needs the whole grammar, and the **advanced
search form is exactly that writer** — it builds text/url/title word clauses +
include/exclude lists + any/all/none tags and commits them. Before it existed, the
suffixed grammar forms were deep-link-only, so no serializer was warranted; the
advanced editor is what flips that.

### selection is a projection, never set

`selection` is a **lossy projection of `query` onto a single axis** — the one thing
the sidebar highlights and the topbar names — computed by `selectionFromQuery`, not by
a second read of the URL:

- a plain single list → `{ kind: 'list', id }`
- a plain single tag → `{ kind: 'tag', id }`
- no list/tag axis at all → `{ kind: 'all' }` (Show All)
- a text search, an exclusion, a tag-`all`, or any multi/compound filter →
  `{ kind: 'none' }` — **no highlight**, and the topbar titles it "Search".

Deriving off `query` (not the raw params) is what makes the highlight **honest**.
`query` carries the default-inbox injection, so bare `/links` resolves to `{ list:
My List }` (the inbox highlights), while a global search — which has a `text` clause —
resolves to `none` instead of a **stale list highlight**. Because `selection` is a
pure function of `query`, the two can never disagree: the sidebar can't claim you're
in "My List" while the pane shows global results.

The `none` arm is the null-object of the union: consumers already branch on
`selection.kind`, so most (`link-add-popover`, `bulk-edit-toolbar`, `main`'s lock
gate, the sidebar's ancestor-expand effect) simply do nothing for `none`, which is
correct — there's no list/tag context during a search. Only two needed an explicit
`none` branch: `isActive` (sidebar — a kind match is enough for `all`/`none`) and
`useSelectionLabel` (topbar — `none` → "Search"). `hrefForSelection('none')` →
`/links` (navigating "to nothing" = home).

### the three-rung ladder (tiering — see business-model.md)

Search splits by **structure, not by whether you can search at all** — the same
Free → Plus → Pro spine as the rest of the app. Free gets real word search across the
whole library (`text`); Plus gets the **structured editor** (field-scoped url/title,
multi-list/multi-tag), gated by the `searchEditor` entitlement; Pro persists queries as
saved searches. The gate is **value-capture, client-enforced** — the editor costs
~nothing to serve, so a bypass only unlocks a convenience. Full rationale and the
entitlement table: [business-model.md](./business-model.md) ("search is a three-rung
ladder") and `packages/shared/src/iap/plans.ts` (`searchEditor`).

### the UI

`SearchBar` (topbar) is a **persistent basic box** plus an **advanced popover**:

- **Basic box** — always visible (the free daily-loop feature shouldn't sit behind a
  click). Type + Enter commits `?text=…`; results reshape the main pane. **Basic
  search is GLOBAL by design**: submitting replaces the whole query with just its text
  (keeping sort), so a search spans the library rather than the list you were on. An
  empty box returns home.
- **Advanced popover** — an anchored panel (not a modal: search is iterative, so the
  results stay visible while you refine). It exposes nearly the whole grammar:
  - the **word trio** over the combined url⊕title haystack — _All / Any / None of
    these words_ → `text.all` / `text.any` / `text.none` (the familiar
    Google-advanced-search shape; since the haystack contains the url, "None"
    also covers the practical exclude-a-domain case);
  - field-scoped **URL contains** / **Title contains** → `url.all` / `title.all`;
  - **tri-state list/tag checklists** — each row cycles include → exclude → off
    (`lists.any`/`lists.none`, tags likewise), with a **Match any/all** toggle on
    the included tags (`tags.any` vs `tags.all`, shown once ≥2 are included). A
    single included tag always commits as `any` — the same set either way, and
    `any` keeps the sidebar highlight and the clean `?tag=` URL where `all` would
    project `selection` to `none`.

  It submits the full query through the same `setQuery` and snapshots the
  committed query on open, so it edits the current query in place and
  **round-trips every clause it renders**. The only grammar forms it does _not_
  render are the field-scoped `url`/`title` `any`/`none` — deep-link-only on
  purpose: `text.any`/`text.none` subsume them in practice, and covering them
  would cost four more inputs for the tail of the tail. Committing from the
  editor drops those four if a hand-built deep link carried them (WYSIWYG: what
  the form shows is exactly what runs); likewise a deep link carrying _both_
  `tag-any` and `tag-all` collapses to `all` mode over their union on open. A dot
  on the trigger marks a committed query carrying filters beyond a single-axis
  selection.

  The additions land on the read engine's cheap paths: `tags.all` is index-driven
  like `tags.any` (the tag driver), list/tag excludes are column predicates (no
  blob decode), and `text.any`/`text.none` cost the same as `text.all` (any text
  clause already forces the extraction join) — see
  [client-queries.md](./client-queries.md).

- **The Plus gate lives in the form, not the write path.** Free users see the trigger
  (visible, not hidden) but opening it presents the upgrade path instead of the
  fields — so the query grammar and URL contract stay tier-agnostic (a Plus user's
  advanced deep link still _parses_ for a free user; they just can't _build_ one).

### deferred, on purpose

Two capabilities are intentionally unbuilt — not missing, and additive when demand
shows. Documented so they aren't re-derived.

- **`match: 'all' | 'any'`** — a top-level toggle for **cross-field OR** ("in these
  lists **OR** with these tags"). The engine currently ANDs all clauses, i.e. an
  implicit `match: 'all'`. Within-field OR already works (`lists.any`, `tags.any`), and
  the common url-OR-title OR is handled by `text`'s combined haystack — so the only
  gap is the genuinely-rare cross-field union, the least-used and most-misread query
  shape. Add it as a one-field/one-param/one-branch/one-toggle increment (default
  `'all'`, URL-only, no migration) the first time a user asks. A full nested boolean
  AST stays out until grouped conditions are explicitly demanded. See
  [business-model.md](./business-model.md) — "boolean" is substantially met by
  field-scoping + `any`/`all`/`none` + `text` without it.
- **Live / debounced search** — the basic box commits on Enter (a history `push`),
  not as-you-type. As-you-type filtering via `router.replace` (no history spam) is a
  refinement, deferred to keep the write path simple and shareable.
