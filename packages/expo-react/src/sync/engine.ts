// Hand-rolled sync engine — the expo sibling of web-react's sync/engine.ts,
// layer 2 in docs/local-first-sync.md. Same design, flow for flow (that file is
// the canonical doc for the protocol: the four-endpoint control plane, R2 as
// source of truth with the op log as a disposable accelerator, the compound
// `(updatedAt, path)` cursor, the commit phase ordering). Runs at the
// app/background level, NOT in React (no hooks). Comments here cover where the
// platform diverges:
//
//  - Storage: decrypted results land in the expo-sqlite store through
//    item-store.ts (which owns the row+junction single-transaction invariant),
//    not Dexie.
//  - Crypto: `encryptionKey` is the account's raw 32-byte key (native has no
//    non-extractable CryptoKey — see expo-crypto). Entity blobs pack/unpack in
//    JS (sync/crypto.ts); `files/` CONTENT encrypts/decrypts path-to-path in
//    the native layer (BracemarkFileCrypto), so file bytes never enter the JS heap.
//  - `files/` content lives DECRYPTED on disk (file-store.ts), not as bytes in
//    the row; the row's `hasDataFile` flag is web's "data absent = not yet
//    lazily downloaded" marker made explicit. loadEntityContent therefore
//    returns a plaintext File (render straight from its file:// uri), not bytes.
//  - No `pathFilter` in SyncDeps: selective sync exists for the bracemark-extension;
//    bracemark-expo is a full-sync client and this package has no other consumer.
//    Reintroduce it from web verbatim if a selective expo surface ever appears.

// puts, which were all stuck behind it. docs/iap.md promises an over-quota
// account "read-only-plus-delete, never data loss"; a wedged queue is not that.
//
// So a refusal is recorded on the outcome — with how many ops it cost, for the
// "12 changes aren't syncing" line (shared sync/status.ts) — and the cycle
// completes. There is no partial retry: being out of bytes or objects is not
// something a subset of the chunk fixes.
//
// This used to also handle `upgrade_required`, the free tier's link cap, which
// DID get a partial retry (drop the `links/` paths, push the rest). That whole
// branch is gone with the cap itself: it is enforced on the create surfaces now
// (docs/business-model.md) — including the iOS share sheet, which reads the
// count off its snapshot rather than the store it can't open
// (docs/share-sheet.md) — so an over-cap link never becomes a pending op.
//
// Blocked ops stay QUEUED, deliberately — they are the user's data, and they
// must upload the moment the account is back under its limits. The cost is one
// refused sign call per blocked chunk per cycle, bounded by the pending queue
// and the rate limiter, and it is what makes recovery automatic rather than
// something the user has to know to trigger.
//
// Any OTHER error still throws: an auth 403, a 5xx that outlived its retries,
// a network failure. Those are real cycle failures.

// is the honest report. A missing record — or an entity row without `data`, or a

// and enqueues its op in ONE transaction (mutations.ts), so an op without a payload
// is never a write that hasn't landed yet; it is a record that went missing
// underneath a queued op, and nothing will put it back. Retrying that forever wedges
