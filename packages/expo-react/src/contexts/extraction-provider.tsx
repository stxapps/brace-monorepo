// The on-device extraction LOOP DRIVER — the expo port of web-react's
// contexts/extraction-provider (that header is canonical: the trigger is OBSERVING
// pending state rather than hooking the save path, which is what makes it cover
// cross-device saves and imports for free; the three cost layers; the single-flight
// drain with a queued rerun; the backed-off self-resume). What follows is only what
// DIFFERS on this platform, and why.
//
//  - THE GATE IS `deviceExtractionMode`, not `serverExtraction`, and there is no extractor
//    client to check (docs/link-extraction.md — _expo drains in the foreground_). Expo
//    never calls `brace-extractor`: native HTTP has no CORS, so the server buys back
//    nothing and would only downgrade the tier, cost a paid request, and disclose the URL.
//    It's a LADDER, not a boolean (entities.ts DEVICE_EXTRACTION_MODES), and the two ends
//    land in different places here: `all` is what arms the drain below (`enabled`), while
//    `off` is checked inside `extractNow` — the only gate that can stop a gestured save.
//
//  - `extractNow` IS NEW — the gestured path (see below). Web has no equivalent because
//    on web every extraction goes through a server and is therefore gated regardless.
//
//  - THE COST LAYERS SURVIVE, BOUNDING SOMETHING ELSE. On web they bound a BILL (every
//    pending link is a paid request). Here every fetch is free, so the same three layers
//    exist for battery, cellular data, politeness to the hosts being fetched, and not
//    doing invisible work for an app the user backgrounded. Two calibration consequences:
//    "Generate all" needs no cost confirmation, and AUTO_BUDGET can sit looser than web's
//    (overshooting spends the user's battery, not the project's money).
//
//  - APPSTATE REPLACES `visibilitychange`, with a caveat worth stating plainly: web's
//    layer-3 promise that "extract-all keeps running while hidden" is NOT literally
//    available on iOS — a backgrounded app is SUSPENDED, so JS stops whether we want it
//    to or not. We therefore do not CANCEL an extract-all on background (a quick app
//    switch resumes seamlessly from the in-memory cursor, which is the honest thing we
//    can offer), but we cannot promise progress the way a hidden browser tab can. That's
//    a platform divergence, not a bug; the real background sweep is the deferred
//    `expo:bg` task (BGAppRefreshTask / WorkManager).
//
//  - THE WAKE SIGNAL IS `useLiveRead` over ['items', 'item_facet_statuses'] instead of
//    liveQuery. Same reactive contract; naming both tables (and only those) keeps a sync
//    drain's `pending_ops` churn from re-firing the read on every queued op.
//
//  - THE STEP IS A SMALL LINK POOL, not `MAX_EXTRACT_URLS`. There's no batch endpoint to
//    fill: a step is STEP links fetched at CONCURRENCY (device-extraction.ts), so the
//    number is about the radio and the target hosts, not a server's fan-out.
