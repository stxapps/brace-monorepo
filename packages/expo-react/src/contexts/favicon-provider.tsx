// On-demand favicons for the UI — the expo port of web-react's
// contexts/favicon-provider (that header is canonical: keyed BY HOST and why
// that's the whole point, fire-and-forget + mounting as the display signal,
// the fan-out bound, why every failure records `none`). One call:
//
//   requestFavicon(host) — "a mounted row is showing this host and has no icon".
//
// Platform divergences:
//
//  - THE FETCH IS DIRECT — `https://{host}/favicon.ico` by native fetch, no
//    extractor proxy. Web needs the proxy because a browser can't read
//    cross-origin image bytes; native HTTP has no CORS, and the design is
//    clients-do-the-work (docs/link-extraction.md — _favicons_, the brace-expo
//    row: direct native fetch; the `<link rel="icon">` upgrade rides page
//    extraction when that lands here).
//  - Validity is a byte sniff, not the proxy's content-type allowlist: only
//    bytes native Image can render get cached as `ok` (lib/image.ts's
//    sniffImageMime), so an HTML error page or an SVG records `none`.
//  - An `ok` icon lands as a plaintext file on disk, not bytes in the row
//    (favicon-store's split-storage header) — the UI renders its derived
//    `file://` uri, so this fetch is the ONE time the bytes cross the JS heap.
//  - GATED ON `deviceExtractionMode`, expo's own extraction ladder (the synced
//    account preference — entities.ts DEVICE_EXTRACTION_MODES, and
//    docs/link-extraction.md, _expo drains in the foreground_): this queue needs
//    `all`, since guessing at a host is un-gestured by construction. The gate is
//    load-bearing, not ceremony (the doc's
//    expo note): every fetch here is STANDALONE — nothing else on this device
//    contacted that host — so for a link saved on another device it's a NEW
//    disclosure of this device's IP to that site, and it must not happen before
//    the user opts into un-gestured network enrichment at all. The gate is NOT
//    `serverExtraction`: that one admits a third party (brace-extractor), which
//    expo never calls, and honoring it here would tie this device's fetching to
//    a decision about a server it doesn't use.
//    The carve-out lives elsewhere: an icon learned WHILE EXTRACTING a page
//    (lib/device-extraction.ts) is written straight to the store by that worker,
//    because it costs no disclosure the page fetch didn't already pay. This
//    queue is the guessing path, and stays behind the opt-in — with ONE
//    exception, `requestFaviconNow` below.
//  - HENCE TWO ENTRY POINTS, on the same axis the extraction provider splits on
//    (gestured vs. un-gestured, not client vs. server). `requestFavicon` is the
//    un-gestured one — a row scrolled past — and is gated. `requestFaviconNow`
//    is the gestured one: the links the user just saved ON THIS DEVICE, whose
//    page `extractNow` is fetching in the same breath, so a `/favicon.ico` GET
//    to that same host discloses nothing the save didn't already. Without it the
//    settings copy would be a half-truth — a link saved here would get its title
//    and preview image with the opt-in off, but a monogram where its icon goes
//    unless the page happened to declare one.
