// The delete-all-data flow — the expo sibling of web-react's
// data/delete-all-data.ts, same shape and the same line it draws (see there
// for the full rationale): one server call wipes the whole data plane, then
// the device-local SYNCED state is wiped to match, while the session, the
// cached subscription copy, and the device-local settings survive — this
// deletes the user's data, not their account or this device's preferences.
// That's exactly what separates it from clearData (clear-data.ts, the
// sign-out teardown): same wipe of the synced stores, opposite treatment of
// the identity/device stores.
