// Default 'worker' runs it in a dedicated worker, off the main thread, so the UI stays
// responsive (brace-web). The browser extension flips this to 'main' at startup (see
// its popup entry): wxt's DEV server serves the module worker cross-origin (from
// http://localhost) to the chrome-extension:// popup, and a cross-origin module worker
// on an extension page hard-crashes the popup renderer. In a popup that does nothing
// else during sign-in, briefly blocking the main thread for the KDF is an acceptable
// trade to avoid that whole class of worker fragility.
//
// The worker path lives in a separate module (./argon2-worker-client) loaded via dynamic
// import only when this runner is 'worker', so 'main'-only consumers (the extension)
// never pull the worker code or its emitted worker chunk into their bundle.

// bytes". The per-user salt is computed by that caller (via `deriveUserSalt` in
