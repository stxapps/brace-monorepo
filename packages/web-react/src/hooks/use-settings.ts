// Reactive read of the user's app settings — the links layout and the theme. Two
// sources feed each (see docs/local-first-sync.md "data model — settings" and the
// Misc settings section):
//
//   - the SYNCED value in `settings/general.enc` (`readSettingsGeneral`), shared
//     across the user's devices; and
//   - the DEVICE-LOCAL value in the `localSettings` store (`getLocalSettings`),
//     which never syncs and is wiped on sign-out.
//
// `linksLayoutSource` (device-local) decides which one the app actually renders, so
// a device can opt out of the synced layout and keep its own. `linksLayout` is that
// resolved value — the single field topbar/main consumed before, now sourced here
// instead of localStorage. ("local" is the internal name for the off-sync source;
// the Misc UI labels its tab "Device".) Both reads are `useLiveQuery`, so a change
// on either source (a local edit, or a sync landing a new `settings/general.enc`)
// re-renders every consumer.

// the newer device untouched — the cost is that every consumer must handle a value
