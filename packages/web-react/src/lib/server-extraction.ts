// The SERVER-tier extraction worker: enrich a PAGE of links' `titleImage` facet via
// `brace-extractor`, then write back — each (resized) image into `files/`, the
// title/imageId display fields + the facet's done/failed bookkeeping into
// `extractions/{id}.enc`. The shared counterpart of the extension's `runExtraction`
// (apps/brace-extension), but driven by an HTTP extract instead of an active-tab
// capture, so its `extractedBy` is `server` (the lowest tier — `tierOf` → 1) and a
// later active-page sighting can UPGRADE it.
//
// BATCHED for latency (docs/link-extraction.md "server extraction"): one `extractMany`
// returns every link's title + imageUrl in ~one round trip — the server resolves the
// URLs CONCURRENTLY — instead of N sequential single-URL calls. We then write TITLES
// FIRST (the page fills with real titles immediately) and fill IMAGES after, through the
// streaming proxy at a small concurrency. A single link short-circuits to the inline
// single-URL path (one round trip, no proxy) — the human-waiting save.
//
// Like the extension worker it writes ONLY `extractions/` + `files/`, NEVER
// `links/{id}.enc` (the writer-split — docs/link-extraction.md), so a backfill can't
// clobber a concurrent user edit. It only ever does `titleImage`: the server tier can't
// screenshot/archive (no renderer) and read-mode parity isn't promised, so those facets
// stay active-context only.
//
// Throws on a wholesale TRANSPORT failure of the extract request itself
// (network/abort/non-2xx) — plus a fail-fast guard if handed more than MAX_EXTRACT_URLS
// links (a caller-contract violation; the drains bound a page to that cap). A transport
// failure isn't a per-link outcome — it tells us nothing about any link — so it propagates
// and the caller stops the drain to retry on the next wake, rather
// than mislabeling every link `failed` (which would burn each link's backoff, flood sync
// with no-op writes, and — in enrichAll — march the cursor through the whole library
// writing failures). Every PER-LINK outcome (success, transient failure, permanent failure)
// is instead RECORDED as a facet write and never re-throws, so once the request succeeds the
// drain always makes progress — a processed link becomes settled (`done`, or
// `failed`/`permanent` which the pending query then skips via backoff) and is never
// re-picked on the next scan.
