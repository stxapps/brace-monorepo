// On-demand favicons for the UI — the FaviconProvider is to `db.favicons` what
// FileContentProvider is to `files/` blobs: the seam that lets a rendered row pull
// bytes it can't fetch itself. It exposes one call:
//
//   requestFavicon(host) — "a mounted row is showing this host and has no icon".
//
// Fire-and-forget: the fetch writes the bytes into `db.favicons`, and the
// requesting row's liveQuery repaints when they land (useFaviconUrl does both
// halves). Mounting is the display signal, same as the preview images.
//
// KEYED BY HOST, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. A page of 200 Hacker News links asks 200
// times and buys exactly ONE fetch; the second link on a known host buys none, ever
// again on this device. That's what makes an icon-per-site affordable when an
// icon-per-link would not be — see FaviconRecord in db.ts.
//
// WHY THE PROXY. The web app can't read cross-origin image bytes (CORS / tainted
// canvas), and pointing an <img> straight at `https://host/favicon.ico` is the
// per-paint third-party leak the design forbids — the same reason the og:image goes
// through GET /v1/image (extract/endpoints.ts). So a favicon rides that existing
// proxy verbatim: no new endpoint, and POST /v1/extract is untouched, so the
// metadata path does no extra work.
//
// We guess `/favicon.ico` rather than reading `<link rel="icon">` from the page,
// which resolves on most sites and costs no contract change. Hosts that declare an
// icon elsewhere record `none` and show the monogram; teaching the extractor's
// HTMLRewriter to return a `faviconUrl` (it already scans `link[rel~="image_src"]`)
// is the accuracy upgrade, and this store is where it would land.
//
// GATED ON THE serverExtraction OPT-IN, unlike FileContentProvider: that provider
// fetches the user's own encrypted bytes from our own R2, whereas this is a
// third-party origin fetch through the extractor — the same trust decision as the
// og:image, so it rides the same switch. With the opt-in off (or no extractor
// configured) this is inert and every row shows its monogram.
