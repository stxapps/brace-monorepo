// The server-extraction LOOP DRIVER for a web React app — the counterpart of the
// extension's background-alarm sweep (apps/brace-extension/entrypoints/background.ts),
// realized as a React provider because brace-web has no background service worker:
// the sync engine already runs in-page (SyncProvider), and so does this.
//
// It does NOT hang off the save path (useLinkMutations.create is untouched). Per
// docs/link-extraction.md ("the queue is a query, not a structure"; "everything is
// async; nothing blocks the save"), the trigger is OBSERVING pending state, not the
// save call — which is what makes it cover cross-device saves and bulk imports for
// free (all just rows the same pending-titleImage queries return), and keeps
// the save off the network.
//
// COST CONTROL — why this isn't a naive "drain everything while the tab is open".
// Each pending link is a paid `brace-extractor` request (HTML fetch + maybe an image
// proxy). A bulk import (tens of thousands of links) left draining unbounded in an
// open — possibly ABANDONED — tab would bill the server for work no one is watching.
// The doc sizes the SYNC poll to the backlog but never the SERVER-REQUEST rate, so
// that ceiling is imposed here, in three layers:
//
//   1. Visibility gate (AUTO mode). The incidental displayed-scoped drain runs only while
//      the tab is VISIBLE; hiding it pauses, revealing it resumes. An abandoned/backgrounded
//      tab spends nothing on extraction the user never asked for. EXTRACT-ALL is EXEMPT (see
//      layer 3) — it's explicit and finite, so it keeps running while hidden.
//   2. Displayed-scoped auto drain. The automatic drain extracts only the pending
//      subset of the links the main pane is currently SHOWING (`reportDisplayedLinkPaths`
//      → `readLinksPendingTitleImageForLinkPaths`), so cost tracks ATTENTION: a 30k-link
//      bulk import never extracts past what the user scrolled into view. A
//      `AUTO_BUDGET`-per-session backstop still caps a user who deep-scrolls a huge
//      library in one sitting — past it the drain stops and flips `autoLimitReached`.
//   3. Explicit "extract all". Draining the WHOLE library is a CONSCIOUS, user-driven
//      job: `extractAll()` switches the source to the full-library scan
//      (`readLinksPendingTitleImagePage`, cursor-paginated newest-first), lifts the auto cap,
//      and — unlike auto — keeps running while the tab is HIDDEN, so the user can click once
//      and walk away instead of babysitting the tab. It isn't visibility-bounded because it's
//      bounded by being FINITE: the cursor walk drains to the end of the library and then
//      CLEARS extract-all mode (it does NOT stay armed to re-fire on later synced/imported links),
//      with the server's per-IP caps as the hard floor. `pause()` stops it early. Surfaced via
//      the context below (controls + running/mode flags; the exact numbers come from the
//      on-demand useExtractionCounts hook) so the app can confirm at the button ("Enrich all
//      X links?") and show "X of Y enriched — [Enrich all] / [Pause]" rather than draining
//      behind the user's back.
//
// The loop, gated on the opt-in + a ready store (+ visibility for AUTO mode):
//   a wake signal kicks it → drain in paced batches, until the backlog is empty, the auto
//   budget is spent or the tab hides (auto mode), the library end is reached (extract-all,
//   which then ends the job), or the user pauses. The SOURCE
//   depends on mode: auto re-scans the displayed page's pending subset each batch;
//   `extractAll()` pages the whole library newest-first via a forward cursor (no top
//   re-scan). Per batch:
//     runServerTitleImageBatch (one extract — server fans out — → titles first, then
//     images pooled → write `files/` + `extractions/`) → requestSync() to push →
//     next page / re-scan → repeat.
// A `failed` link is marked + backed-off, so it drops out of the scan and the loop
// always terminates (no tight retry spin).
//
// The server's per-IP egress budget + rate/size/time caps (docs/link-extraction.md
// "server extraction") remain the non-negotiable FLOOR: the gates here are UX/cost
// shaping for the honest client; the extractor's own caps bound the bill regardless.
