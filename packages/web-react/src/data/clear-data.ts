// The sign-out teardown: wipe EVERY device-local per-account store in one place.
// This is the one operation that deliberately reaches across all the stores —
// Dexie tables plus the non-Dexie caches — so it lives on its own rather than in
// any single store (each of those stays single-responsibility). The local store
// holds DECRYPTED bookmarks, so a second user on the same device must not read the
// first's plaintext; `localSettings`, `locks`, and the cached subscription copy are
// wiped for the same "next account here must not inherit this one's state" reason.
// Deliberately not account-scoped: `items` carries no owner column (see
// PendingOpRecord in db.ts), so a scoped clear would leave the previous account's
// plaintext behind.
//
// Called from auth-provider's endSession (and so the onSessionInvalid path)
// alongside clearSession — so this is the ONE teardown choke point every sign-out
// path (deliberate, expired-token, and the signed-out resolution guard) funnels
// through; anything that must not outlive an account on this device belongs here.
// (delete-all-data.ts wipes a SUBSET while staying signed in — synced stores yes,
// identity/device stores no; keep the two aligned when adding a store here.)
