// in ONE transaction, then the sync engine drains the queue (encrypt → PUT →
// commit) on the next cycle. This is the "the UI writes the local store, then
// enqueues a pending op" path the db.ts/engine.ts comments describe; nothing else
// in the app wrote `items` before — only the engine did, on the way down.

// Two stores in one transaction so a write is atomic: the local store and the
// durable queue can never disagree about whether an edit happened (a crash
// between them would either lose the edit or orphan a queue entry). The engine
// restamps `items.updatedAt` with R2's authoritative time on commit, so the
// local value here is provisional — we keep the pre-edit server stamp as the
// base, which is exactly what reconcile compares against.
