// The dangling-extraction janitor. A DANGLING extraction is an `extractions/{id}.enc`
// whose `links/{id}.enc` no longer exists — minted by the writer-split's one delete
// race: device A destroys a link (deleting link + extraction + files together, see
// useLinkMutations.destroy) while device B still has an extraction write-back for it
// in flight or queued, so B's put lands after A's deletes and the machine half comes
// back without its link. Nothing ever reads it again (every join goes link →
// extraction), but it's not harmless: it skews both facet-count readers (queries.ts —
// its outcome token has no link-total entry to cancel, so `pending` UNDER-counts,
// the one error direction the extract-all wake can't tolerate) and it leaks storage —
// the blob itself plus the `files/` content it references (image/screenshot/page copy,
// easily hundreds of KB) persist in R2 against the user's quota and in every device's
// local store, with no other reclamation path (destroy can't — the link is gone).
// So danglings are fixed by DELETION here, not by accounting in the count queries.
//
// WHO MAY CALL THIS — full-sync clients only, after a completed sync cycle. The test
// is "link absent LOCALLY", and it queues REMOTE deletes on that basis, so it's only
// sound where local absence proves server absence:
//   - the store must hold a complete snapshot: first sync done AND a cycle finished
//     this session (the initial fallback listing walks in path order, and
//     `extractions/` sorts before `links/`, so absence mid-pull is meaningless);
//   - the client must sync the WHOLE library: a selective-sync client (the browser
//     extension's documented future — docs/link-extraction.md) that skips some
//     `links/` would judge healthy extractions dangling and delete them for every
//     device. That's why brace-web mounts the trigger (DanglingExtractionSweep) and
//     no shared always-on provider does.
// A link resurrected on the server concurrently (edit-vs-delete LWW) can still lose
// its extraction to a sweep that raced it — the machine half only: it re-queues as
// pending and re-extracts, no user data at stake.
//
// Cost: one keys-only index scan of `extractions/` plus one keyed existence probe of
// the co-keyed `links/` paths — no blobs are read unless a dangling is actually found
// (normally none). Per-dangling teardown mirrors destroy's: `files/` content first,
// entities after, so an interruption leaves the extraction still dangling (with its
// refs intact) for the next run to finish — idempotent, and the queued deletes are
// harmless tombstones upstream if two devices sweep the same garbage.
