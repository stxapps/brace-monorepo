// for reactive reads, is the doc's preferred default. Holds DECRYPTED data: the
// sync engine decrypts blobs with @stxapps/web-crypto before they land here, and
// the network layer never sees plaintext.
//
// Kept in a SEPARATE database ('brace-data') from the raw-IDB session store
// ('brace-session' in session-store.ts). The session DB holds auth/key material and
// is hand-rolled; Dexie wants to own its own schema/versioning, so the two don't
// share a database. Mirrors the auth≠sync split: auth state lives in one place,
// synced user data in another.
//
// Within THIS database, `syncMeta` and `items` share one Dexie instance on
// purpose: the gate invariant ties the cursor (syncMeta) to the items snapshot,
// so they must stay consistent — one database keeps a cross-store atomic
// transaction possible (IndexedDB transactions can't span databases).

// is the gate that lets the app render local data instead of blocking on a full
// pull, and it's the ONLY way to tell "synced, zero items" apart from "never
// synced" — without it, an empty local store is ambiguous.
//
// The cursor is a TIMESTAMP, not a seq. Per docs/local-first-sync.md the wire
// cursor is the compound key `(updatedAt, path)` — R2's `LastModified` (epoch ms)
// plus a path tiebreak — never the op log's `seq`. `seq` stays internal to the DO:
// it can't be reconstructed from an R2 listing, so a DO rebuild or fallback would
// have no seq to resume from, whereas the newest `LastModified` in a listing
// always IS the cursor. The two halves map directly to the `ops/list` query
// params `since` + `sincePath` (see @stxapps/shared sync/endpoints.ts).

// One decrypted entity, keyed by its per-file path — the generic local store the
// sync engine writes into (one entity per file, per docs/local-first-sync.md
// "data model"). Every namespace flows through here identically: `links/{id}.enc`
// (the always-resident link index), `tags/{id}.enc`, `lists/{id}.enc`,
// `pins/{id}.enc`, `extractions/{id}.enc` (per-link extraction bookkeeping —
// docs/link-extraction.md), `settings/<concern>.enc`, and lazily-fetched
// `files/{id}.enc` content.
//
// "Item" (not "entity" — that reads like a server-side D1 row — and not "file"
// — that's the `files/` namespace specifically) is the established name for this
// one-table-of-every-type store in E2E sync systems (Standard Notes, Joplin).
//
// - `path` is the FULL relative path (`links/l_abc.enc`) AND the primary key — the
//   same key the op log, pending queue, and R2 use, so reconcile can compare a
//   server op to a local record directly (there is no separate id; the path IS
//   the id). Named `path`, not `id`, to match every other layer and to avoid
//   colliding with the entities' own logical `id` field (lists/tags carry one
//   inside the blob — see entities.ts).
// - `updatedAt` is the per-path R2 `LastModified` (epoch ms) the server stamped;
//   it drives last-writer-wins and is the value compared in both incremental
//   apply and the fallback listing — never Dexie's local write time.
// - `data` is the decrypted blob bytes (the sync engine decrypts with
//   @stxapps/web-crypto before it lands here; plaintext never crosses the
//   network). Absent for a `files/` content record that's been seen but not yet
//   lazily downloaded — only its `updatedAt` is known.
//
// The `item*` columns are the QUERY PROJECTION: the few list-view fields lifted
// out of the decrypted `data` blob so IndexedDB can index them. Without them a
// view like "newest 30 links in this list" would have to read+JSON.parse every
// `links/` blob into memory and sort there — O(library) on every reactive tick. A
// compound index over these columns turns it into a keyset walk that materializes
// only the page shown. They're DERIVED, not authoritative: `data` is the source
// of truth, and every column here is computed FROM it by the single projector
// (data/projection.ts `toItemRecord`) that every write site must funnel through —
// so the index can never drift from the bytes it indexes (no second table, no
// cross-table transaction; the column is written in the same `put` as `data`).
// All are sparse: a record gets a key only where the field applies (a `files/`
// content record has none; only `links/` links carry `itemListId`/`itemTagIds`),
// and IndexedDB simply omits keyless records from that index — exactly the
// per-type filtering we want.
