// The device-local last-known subscription copy — a tiny per-device cache over
// `GET /v1/iap/status`, owned here so the hooks layer (use-entitlements) stays
// reactivity-only. Read/write/clear the persisted shape; no network, no React.
//
// Why localStorage, not Dexie/IDB like its sibling stores: the value is wanted
// SYNCHRONOUSLY at first render, to seed react-query's placeholderData so an
// offline or cold start keeps the account's plan instead of flashing free and
// re-locking features until the network answers (localStorage is sync; IDB
// isn't). It's per-device cache — not user data, not synced.
//
// Trust model: this cache only gates CLIENT-side feature UX; everything that
// costs money is re-checked server-side at `files/sign` regardless (see
// brace-api lib/quota.ts). A stale cached plan therefore fails soft in both
// directions — an expired subscription keeps client features offline for a
// while (they cost ~nothing), and a fresh upgrade unlocks as soon as the status
// query lands.
