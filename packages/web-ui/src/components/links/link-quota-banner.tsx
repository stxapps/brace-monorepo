// What a create surface renders INSTEAD of its form once the library is at the
// plan's link cap: the count, why saving is off, and the caller's upgrade CTA.
//
// It replaces the form rather than sitting above it because at the cap the form
// is dead — every field in it feeds a save that can't happen. This is also why
// the cap does NOT route through the paywall dialog (brace-web's
// PaywallProvider): that's the ACTION-INTERRUPT pattern, for an affordance that
// stays live and explains itself on click. A full library isn't an action the
// user took — it's true before they touch anything — so the honest UI states it
// up front instead of taking a URL and then refusing it.
//
// The copy points at emptying the Trash, not at deleting links: a trashed link
// still holds its `links/{id}.enc` blob and still counts against the cap (see
// useLinkQuota on why the count is trash-inclusive), so "move it to Trash" would
// be advice that doesn't work.
//
// The CTA is a slot: brace-web passes a next/link to /settings/subscription,
// while the extension (no such route of its own) opens the web app's page in a
// tab. Everything else — the copy, the count, the shape — lives here so the two
// surfaces can't drift.
