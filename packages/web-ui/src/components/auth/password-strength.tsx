// The create-account entropy gate (docs/account.md). Callers gate on the returned
// `guessesLog10` against PASSWORD_MIN_GUESSES_LOG10 (10^18 ≈ 60 bits) on the
// TYPED-your-own path only; the generated passphrase is ~77 bits by construction and
// bypasses this entirely.
//
// zxcvbn's own 0–4 `score` is deliberately NOT surfaced by this module. It's a
// 5-bucket label over the same guess estimate, and its top bucket is open-ended
// ("guesses >= 1e10" ≈ 33 bits) — so score 4 spans `Summer2026Brace!` (~35 bits)
// through a 7-word passphrase (~121 bits). Anything a caller could gate on it is
// wrong, so it doesn't leave this file; `displayScore` below is ours, derived from
// the same floors as the gate. See the constant's comment in `shared`
// `auth/credentials.ts`.
//
// zxcvbn is heavy (~400 KB with its dictionaries), so it's DYNAMICALLY imported
// on first use — it never lands in the initial auth-route bundle. Until it loads,
// both outputs are null and the caller keeps submit disabled (never gate-open before
// the estimator is ready).

// Display bands over the same guess estimate the gate uses — one per meter segment,
// so `displayScore` (0–3) is both the band index and the last segment lit. The top
// band IS the gate (PASSWORD_MIN_GUESSES_LOG10), so a full green meter and a passing
// entropy gate are the same condition by construction rather than by clamping.

// (penalizing `userInputs` — e.g. the username — so a username-derived password
// scores low). Returns { guessesLog10: number | null, displayScore: 0–3 | null, ready }.
// Both outputs are null while loading or when the password is empty.
//
// `guessesLog10` is the raw, uncapped estimate — the value callers gate on.
// `displayScore` is for the meter only: a band index derived from BOTH floors the
// gate enforces, so it can never read "Strong" while submit is blocked ("green meter
// but disabled button"). Below `minLength` it's held one band under the top; zxcvbn
// can't be told either floor — it reports estimated guess counts and buckets them —
// so we bucket them ourselves here.
//
// Pass the CANONICAL password so both the length and the estimate match what
// actually derives the KEK.
