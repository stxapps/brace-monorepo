// The PERMANENT/TRANSIENT axis for one link's failed extraction — `permanent` (never
// retry) vs `failed` (retry once cooled past `backoff` — sync/extraction.ts).
//
// This decision is SYNCED, not local: `isFacetEligible` settles `permanent` for every
// device, so if two tiers classify the same outcome differently, a link's fate depends on
// which device happened to see it first. That's why the whole axis lives here in `shared`
// — same reason as `tierOf`/`backoff` — with one rule per input VOCABULARY and one
// adapter to join them:
//
//   isPermanent(error)              — the extract contract's `ExtractError` enum, all the
//                                     extractor can say about a URL it fetched itself.
//   verdictForStatus(status, …)     — a raw HTTP status, what a client that did its own
//                                     fetch has (brace-expo's on-device extraction, and
//                                     the extractor's `bad_status` code once it's relayed).
//   verdictForExtractError(…)       — the contract adapter: prefer the status when the
//                                     result carried one, else fall back to the enum.
//
// Callers pass `priorAttempts` as a THUNK because only one branch (403) needs it and
// reading it costs a store hit + a blob decode; the common paths stay decode-free.

// The two terminal states a FAILURE can settle into (`done` is the success half of
// `facetSchema.status`).
export type ExtractVerdict = Exclude<Facet['status'], 'done'>;

// Which extract errors are permanent. `blocked` (SSRF reject) and the content caps
// (`unsupported_type`, `too_large`) won't change on a retry; a timeout or a fetch failure
// might, so those stay transient.
//
// `bad_status` is deliberately NOT classified here — it spans 404 (permanent) and 503
// (transient), and the enum alone can't tell them apart. Prefer `verdictForExtractError`,
// which routes a result carrying `status` to `verdictForStatus`; this function's
// `bad_status` → transient is the fallback for a result without one (an older extractor).

// server WOULD have (brace-expo uses `0` for a non-http(s) URL, `415` for a non-HTML
// content-type, `204` for an empty body), which lands them on the same rules as the real

  // challenge, a shared mobile IP in a penalty box), so retrying is often right — but a
  // site that simply refuses this client will return it forever, and a link retried until
  // the heat death of the app is worse than one settled. So: retry it up the normal backoff
  // ladder, and give up once the ladder has topped out at EXTRACTION_BACKOFF_MAX_MS.
