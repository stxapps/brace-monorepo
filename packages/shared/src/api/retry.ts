// a client can never compute its remaining budget up front; reactive
// 429-check-and-wait is the required half, with the callers' natural pacing
// (sequential chunks, small pools) as the proactive half. Lives in `shared` beside
// the client it wraps so every app (web, extension, future expo) retries by

// retryable: a non-429 4xx (the server rejected the request on its merits — it
// won't change on retry) or any non-transport throw (a bug should surface, not
// spin). An abort surfaces as a DOMException, so a cancelled call is never retried.
