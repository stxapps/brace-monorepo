// Handles nobody may register — system/role words and brand names, so no account
// can impersonate the product or a privileged function. Because `usernameSchema`
// backs every auth endpoint's payload (endpoints.ts), the block is enforced on the
// SERVER too, not just the form. Match is against the CANONICAL username
// (canonicalizeUsername → trim + NFKC + lowercase — the exact form the server
// stores as the unique handle), so casing/Unicode variants ("Admin", "ADMIN") all
// collapse to one lowercase entry and can't slip through. Exact-match only (not
// substring), so "admin123" stays allowed. Every entry is charset-valid
// ([a-z0-9_], ≥3 chars) — the regex already rejects anything the set couldn't hit.

// A hard length floor is defense-in-depth BEHIND the zxcvbn strength gate — zxcvbn
// is a heuristic that can be fooled, but length it can't be tricked past — and this
// system's threat model is harsh (the wrapped door is served pre-auth = an offline
// brute-force surface, and there is no reset). The UX cost is ~nil: the default is
// the generated ~77-bit passphrase, so this only bites users who insist on typing
// their own. Kept SEPARATE from passwordSchema so sign-in never inherits this floor
// (see above). The strength meter holds below its passing band under this same
// length, so the meter and this gate stay one consistent signal (usePasswordStrength).
//
// 20 pairs with PASSWORD_MIN_GUESSES_LOG10 below: zxcvbn models an unmatched
// password as 10^length guesses (~3.32 bits/char, charset-independent), so 10^18
// already implies ~19 chars for anything its dictionaries don't match. Rounding the
// length floor to 20 makes the two rules one story — "at least 20 characters, and
// not predictable" — instead of two numbers that bite at different moments.

// 5-bucket label whose top bucket is open-ended ("guesses >= 1e10" ≈ 33 bits), so
// score 4 covers everything from `Summer2026Brace!` (~35 bits) to our generated
// 7-word passphrase (~121 bits by zxcvbn's own estimate). The underlying
// `guessesLog10` is uncapped and is the real signal.
//
// Why 60 bits: the wrapped password door is served pre-auth, so guessing is offline
// and parallel, and there is no reset — a win is total and permanent. Behind
// ARGON2_PARAMS (64 MiB, t=3 → order 10^3–10^4 guesses/sec/GPU), 10^18 is millions
// of GPU-years, while the ~27 bits that `score >= 3` actually admitted was ~hours on
// a single GPU.
//
// This is a floor on zxcvbn's ESTIMATE, not on true entropy. The estimate runs
// conservative for random strings (a 16-char CSPRNG password is really ~95 bits but
// models as 53) and can run optimistic for patterned ones it fails to match — it
// can't know the user's dog's name. The headroom covers the latter; the former is
// why this only bites the escape hatch and never the generated default.
