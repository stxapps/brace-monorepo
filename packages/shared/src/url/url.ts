// `new URL(...)`-based rendering would disagree across surfaces.

// Matches a leading RFC-3986 scheme (`scheme:` — ALPHA then ALPHA/DIGIT/+/-/.).
// Used to detect EXPLICIT-scheme input before we'd otherwise prepend https://,
// because `new URL(...)` can't tell `mailto:x` from `host:port` (both parse as a
// scheme with an empty host), so we discriminate on the raw text first.

// - An explicit scheme is trusted only when it's http(s); any other scheme
//   (mailto:, ftp:, tel:, the `javascript:` of a bookmarklet, …) returns null —
//   we never store a non-web or script URL as an href. Note this also rejects a
//   schemeless host:port like "example.com:8080" (indistinguishable from a
//   scheme); the user can prefix http(s):// or confirm-and-save it raw.
// - Schemeless input gets https:// prepended, but must have a DOTTED host, so
//   plain prose ("note to self") isn't silently promoted to a URL.
//
// Normalization is MINIMAL on purpose: we only prepend the missing scheme and
// return the input otherwise untouched. We deliberately do NOT return
// `new URL(value).href`, which would mutate meaning (append a trailing slash,
// re-encode the path, …); query strings, fragments, and trailing slashes can be
// significant, so only the unambiguously-safe missing-scheme fix is applied.
// Heavier canonicalization (for dedup identity) belongs in a separate derived
// key, not in the stored URL.

// null is a SOFT result: the caller should warn and let the user confirm-and-save
// the raw text, rather than block on a debatable-but-deliberate URL.
