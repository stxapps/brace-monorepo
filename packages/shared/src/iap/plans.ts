// The subscription plans and what each one entitles — the single source of truth
// both edges read (see docs/business-model.md "tiers"): the CLIENT paywall UI
// derives feature gates and upsell copy from `entitlementsOf(plan)`, and the
// SERVER quota gate (bracemark-api lib/quota.ts, applied at `files/sign`) enforces
// the same numbers. Defining the limits once here is the same move as
// LINK_TITLE_MAX in sync/entities.ts: the place that enforces a limit and the
// place that displays it can never drift apart.
//
// What's enforceable where is deliberately asymmetric (the E2E trust model):
// content is opaque to the server, but PATHS are not — so the server COULD hard-
// enforce anything countable blind, while per-feature gates (read-mode,
// screenshot, the page-copy meter) can only ever be client-enforced UX backed by
// the blob rules. What the server CANNOT do is tell one `files/` blob from
// another: a preview image, a screenshot, and a page copy are all opaque
// `files/{id}.enc` under the same namespace, so there is no server-visible signal
// to allow the free preview image while denying a heavy blob. The free tier
// therefore stores `files/` blobs (client-extracted preview images — see
// docs/business-model.md "tiers"), bounded server-hard only by the byte/count
// backstop (maxBytes, maxFiles); the heavy-blob distinction is client-enforced.
//
// Of what the server COULD count, it now counts only what it must: maxBytes and
// maxFiles, the ceilings whose bypass is an unbounded R2 bill. `maxLinks` is
// countable and is NOT counted — a link-cap bypass costs a few hundred KB and is
// bounded by maxBytes anyway, and enforcing it blind dragged in a create-vs-update
// existence check, a partial-push retry in the sync engine, and a sync state for
// partial refusals. So the hard walls sit exactly where the COST is, not
// everywhere the server can see; a client-side bypass unlocks features that cost
// ~nothing to serve, and one conversion lever we chose to run on the honor system
// (docs/business-model.md, _the link cap is honor-system_).
//
// So the entitlements below split into two kinds of gate (see the same split in
// docs/business-model.md "tiers"):
//   - COST-DEFENSIVE (maxLinks, maxPageCopies, maxFiles, maxBytes,
//     serverExtraction) — protect real cost / the moat; server-hard where
//     countable.
//   - VALUE-CAPTURE (locks, nestedLists, searchEditor, smartLists,
//     savedSearches, aiTier) — pure willingness-to-pay for things that cost
//     ~nothing to serve; all client-enforced. Their spine: Plus unlocks
//     STRUCTURAL organization (nested lists today, plus the tag-hierarchy +
//     per-list-link-order levers the doc plans — see the DOC-AHEAD-OF-CODE note
//     below) + the structured search editor + privacy; Pro unlocks AUTOMATED /
//     dynamic organization + intelligence (it arranges itself).
// What is deliberately NOT an entitlement stays free for everyone: theme, FLAT
// tags, flat lists, pin, sort options, MANUAL reorder of list/tag SIBLINGS (and
// of pinned links), multi-select move/tag/delete, and full data export — habit-
// loop, table-stakes, or anti-lock-in, so never gated. Sibling/tree/pin order is
// free across the board: at the free tier's scale (≤200 links, a handful of
// lists/tags) hand-arranging is a cheap habit-loop nicety with ~no willingness-
// to-pay, and pins already give free hand-ordering of links.
//
// DOC-AHEAD-OF-CODE: docs/business-model.md's tiers table lists two more Plus
// value-capture levers that are NOT yet entitlement fields here, because the
// product decision is still open (they ship on user feedback, not at launch):
//   - tag HIERARCHY (nested tags) — the tag analog of nestedLists; only DEPTH is
//     the lever, FLAT tags stay free (above).
//   - per-list manual LINK ordering — a hand-curated sequence WITHIN a list
//     (distinct from the free sibling/tree order); Plus-worthy only because it
//     pays off past the free tier's link ceiling.
// When either ships, add a `tagHierarchy` / `linkOrdering` boolean below
// (free:false, plus:true, pro:true — mirroring nestedLists) and the table and
// the data reconverge.
//
// The same doc's PRICING section describes three things that are NOT
// entitlements — a monthly cadence, a free trial, and the lifetime launch lever.
// All three now have constants below, and all three follow the same rule as Pro:
// the CATALOG is fully specified here, the STOREFRONT is a separate, smaller
// list. None of them changes this table, because none of them changes what a
// plan unlocks:
//   - MONTHLY is a second billing CADENCE of the same plan, not a plan. It lives
//     in PLAN_USD_PER_MONTH + AVAILABLE_CADENCES, and shipping it is checkout-
//     contract + catalog work (a second `pri_…` per plan, a second store SKU) —
//     see docs/iap.md, _open follow-ups_.
//   - a TRIAL is a subscription STATE: a trialing account is entitled to exactly
//     `plus`, so entitlementsOf() is already correct for it and the fold already
//     treats `trialing` as entitled. Only its LENGTH is data (TRIAL_DAYS).
//   - LIFETIME is a one-time purchase of the `plus` entitlement with no expiry —
//     the fold's `expiresAt: null` case. It is a PRICE and a policy, not a tier.

  // / multi-tag, boolean queries. Client-side, so it costs ~nothing to serve,

//   - Only list what actually SHIPS. Reader view, screenshots, page copies, and AI
//     are gated in ENTITLEMENTS above but not yet built, so they are NOT promised

//     server-side link previews + app lock/hidden lists + the structured search
//     editor.
//   - Never sell the preview IMAGE. It is free for everyone (a client extracts it
//     at zero cost to us), and this list said "Preview images" for a while from
//     back when it was a paid lever — which read as "free users get no
//     thumbnails", the opposite of the tiers table. What Plus actually gates is
//     `serverExtraction`, and the honest claim is COVERAGE, not quality: the

//     where CORS blocks the tab, and the back-fill of imported links. Free gets
//     the BEST extractor, on the device doing the saving.
//   - Pro's copy is kept as spec-in-waiting even though Pro isn't sold: only
