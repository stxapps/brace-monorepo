// both platforms' import views render the same progress phases, the same
// outcome counters, and the same quota message, so those live here rather than
// in two copies that can only agree by luck. Beside backup.ts in the
// data-lifecycle namespace (docs/data-lifecycle.md).

// The running phases, in order. `sync` and `parse` are indeterminate; `items`
// counts entity writes, `files` counts blob restores (bracemark backup only).
