// Fractional-index ordering for lists/tags (entities.ts `rank`). The thin
// platform-agnostic wrapper over `fractional-indexing` so every client mints
// order keys by ONE definition — and so the dep is swappable from here alone.
//
// Why a string key and not an integer position: each entity is its own
// encrypted file under last-writer-wins (docs/local-first-sync.md). With integer
// positions, inserting/moving one entity renumbers its siblings → many file
// writes → many LWW points → concurrent reorders clobber. A fractional key lets
// an insert between neighbours A and B compute `between(A.rank, B.rank)` and
// write ONLY the moved entity's file. A.rank and B.rank are untouched, so two
// devices moving two different entities never conflict.
//
// Keys sort by plain ascending string comparison (`<`), which is all buildTree
// (tree.ts) needs. Concurrent inserts at the same slot can mint equal keys — a
// tie, never data loss — broken deterministically by id in the sort.
