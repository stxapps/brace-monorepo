// The shared extraction OUTCOME rules — title normalization, quality ranking, retry pacing,
// and (re)extraction eligibility — that every client must agree on. They operate on the
// `facetSchema` fields in entities.ts (`extractedBy`, `attempts`/`extractedAt`) but are kept here, beside
// each other rather than in the schema file, the same split `rank.ts`/`tree.ts`
// make: entities.ts is the plaintext SHAPE contract; this is the BEHAVIOR.
//
// Both live in `shared`, not in any client, so the extension, the future Expo app,
// and `brace-extractor` rank quality and pace retries by identical rules — the
// reason the docs (link-extraction.md "the extraction entity") put them in `shared`.
// Neither value is stored on the facet: each is a pure function of a stored input
// (`extractedBy`, `attempts`/`extractedAt`), so there's no drift-prone second field
// to keep in sync (the same reason there's no `tier` / `nextEligibleAt` column).

// QUALITY rank derived from a facet's `extractedBy` (`platform:env`, e.g.
// `extension:fg`). Higher = better: active-page (`:fg`, live DOM / WebView) beats
// bg-fetch (`:bg`, raw HTML) beats `server` (brace-extractor). An UNRECOGNIZED value
// ranks 0 — conservatively lowest — so a future platform/env a newer client emits
// (round-tripped through `looseObject`) can never wrongly out-rank a known active-page
// result. A client may re-extract (UPGRADE) a `done` facet only when its own tier is
// strictly higher than the facet's.

  return 0; // unknown → conservatively lowest
}

// Retry pacing for a TRANSIENT `failed` facet: the deciding client retries once
// `now >= extractedAt + backoff(attempts)`. `attempts` is the number of tries so far
// (1 after the first failure), so the delay grows exponentially from a base and is
// capped — long enough that a flaky host isn't hammered, bounded so a link isn't
// stuck forever. A HARD failure is `status: 'permanent'` instead (never retried), so
// this curve only ever paces transient retries.

// Pending when the facet is ABSENT (absence = pending — the writer-split, see entities.ts), or
// when a transient `failed` facet has cooled past its backoff (`now >= extractedAt +
// backoff(attempts)`). `done` and `permanent` (404/410, robots) are settled — never eligible,
// so one device's synced outcome stops every device. Facet-agnostic: the rule is identical for
// `titleImage`, `screenshot`, etc., so callers pull the facet they care about and pass it in.
// Shared for the same reason as `backoff`/`tierOf`: every client (brace-web, the future Expo
// app) must decide eligibility by identical rules.

// server extractor (raw-HTML og:title/<title>) and the extension (live-DOM og:title/
// document.title) both feed the same capped field, so a long or whitespace-noisy title
// can't be valid from one writer but rejected from the other. Returns undefined for an
// absent/blank title so callers can fall back (`customTitle ?? title ?? host(url)`).

// Build a facet-state write — the single constructor every extraction WRITER uses to
// stamp an outcome, so the four base fields are filled the same way by every tier
// (server `brace-extractor`, `extension:fg`, and any future Expo client) instead of each
// re-spelling the literal:
//   - `extractedAt: Date.now()` is ALWAYS set — eligibility is `extractedAt + backoff(attempts)`,
//     so omitting it would key off epoch 0 (instantly eligible → no cooldown). Centralizing
//     it here means no client can forget it.
//   - `attempts: 0` is a PLACEHOLDER: on a `failed` write `writeExtraction` overrides it with
//     the prior facet's `attempts + 1` (the real cross-cycle counter, so `backoff` escalates
//     across repeated failures); a `done` write resets to 0; `permanent` never retries so it's
//     irrelevant. The writer owns the number because only its read-merge sees the prior value.
// `extractedBy` is the caller's `platform:env` tier string (`tierOf` ranks quality from it).
// `extra` carries any tier-specific looseObject passthrough (e.g. the extension's read-mode
// `fileId`) — round-tripped by `facetSchema`'s `looseObject`.
