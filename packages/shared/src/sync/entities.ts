// Plaintext entity shapes — what's INSIDE the ciphertext of each synced file
// (see docs/local-first-sync.md "data model" + "plaintext typing"). These are a
// cross-platform contract like the blob wire format: every platform encrypts and
// decrypts the same JSON, so the shapes live here in `shared`, not in any app.
//
// Unlike the endpoint contracts next door (endpoints.ts), NOTHING here ever
// crosses the wire in plaintext — the server never sees these fields. The
// schemas exist for the CLIENT read layer: parse a decrypted item's bytes into a
// typed entity before handing it to the UI.
//
// Every object is `z.looseObject` — unknown fields pass through — on purpose.
// Devices upgrade at different times: a newer client may add a field, and an
// older client that parses, edits, re-encrypts, and re-uploads the file must
// ROUND-TRIP that unknown field, not silently strip it (a strict schema would
// make every old-client edit destroy new-client data). For the same reason,
// never repurpose or re-type an existing field — add a new one.
//
// Timestamps are epoch milliseconds, the convention everywhere else in the sync
// system. The `updatedAt` here is the USER-MEANINGFUL edit time, written inside
// the ciphertext by the editing client — distinct from the server-side R2
// `LastModified` that drives sync ordering (an ItemRecord/op-log `updatedAt`),
// which is infrastructure the plaintext doesn't depend on.

// The plaintext of `links/{id}.enc` — one link. Small by design (< ~2 KB
// budget): list-view fields only, so the whole library is browsable offline
// after first sync. Heavy content (archives, screenshots, long notes) lives in
// separate `files/{id}.enc` blobs referenced by id — never inlined here.
// `tagIds`/`listId` hold ids of `tags/{id}.enc` / `lists/{id}.enc` files; a
// dangling id (tag deleted on another device) is NORMAL and the UI skips it,
// never errors.
//
// Reference fields end in `Id`/`Ids` and store the BARE entity id, never a full
// path: the `{namespace}` prefix + `.enc` suffix is applied at the read edge
// (paths.ts), the same convention the link's own `links/{id}.enc` path follows.
// Char caps for the inline, user-/extraction-written text fields — the single
// source of truth the input edge, the extractor, and this schema all share, so the
// limit can't drift between where it's enforced and where it's validated. They
// protect the `< ~2 KB` metadata budget (see local-first-sync.md "metadata vs
// content"); counts are UTF-16 length, so worst-case multi-byte text stays bounded.
// Keep them GENEROUS: because this schema parses persisted bytes, a value over the
// cap fails to parse and drops the WHOLE link from the UI — so the cap must never
// trip a legitimate value, and writers (the editor, the extractor truncating
// og:title) enforce the same number up front. `url` is deliberately NOT capped: it
// is the link's identity, so truncating it would corrupt the link — the per-user
// byte quota is its only backstop.

  // same rule and pattern as `pageArchiveId`. Distinct from a full-page screenshot

  // can't clobber a user's override — and clearing the field reverts to the fetched
  // value, which is still present. A title the user types AT SAVE counts as an
  // override too (it's sticky), so it lands here, not in `title`. `customImageId`

  // as `imageId`.
  //
  // These live here in `links/` — one file, one user gesture, beside
