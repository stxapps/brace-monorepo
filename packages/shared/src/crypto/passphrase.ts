// Generated-passphrase support: a high-entropy `password` the create-account
// ceremony offers as the safe default (docs/account.md — "generated password").
// The words are just a normal password string — they flow through the SAME
// password door as a typed one, so nothing in the derivation contract changes;
// only the UI offers them. See docs/account.md ("a password-derived wallet").
//
// Pure and platform-agnostic, so it lives in `shared` (the lowest layer): web
// generates today, the future Expo/native client tomorrow, and both MUST pick
// from the identical wordlist or the same click yields a different entropy space
// (a silent contract drift). The list is pinned by a hash vector in
// contract-vectors.ts so it can never change unnoticed.

// We reuse BIP-39's English wordlist (from the same @scure/@noble supply chain
// as the rest of the crypto layer): 2048 curated words = EXACTLY 11 bits each,
// so uniform selection is an 11-bit mask with NO modulo bias and no rejection
// sampling. We take only the list — not generateMnemonic(), which forces fixed
// 12/24-word BIP-39 sizes with a checksum; we want a plain N-word passphrase.

// app's react-native-get-random-values polyfill) — never Math.random.
//
// Hyphen, not space: the string is a `password` (no trim/normalization on the
// derivation path — see derivePasswordKek), shown once and RE-TYPED at the
// confirm step and every sign-in. A space is a re-entry footgun there — a stray
// trailing space or double-space silently derives a different KEK, and mobile
// keyboards auto-capitalize / autocorrect ". " after one. A hyphen reads as a
// single token to the keyboard and has no leading/trailing/collapse ambiguity.
// The separator is NOT a derivation contract (generation is random + per-user;
// only the wordlist is pinned), so this is free to choose for UX.
//
// Each word draws 16 random bits and masks to the low 11 (& 0x7ff → 0..2047).
