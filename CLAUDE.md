## General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax

# Workspace

Packages `@stxapps/{shared,react,web-ui,web-crypto,web-react,expo-crypto,expo-react}`;
apps `bracemark-{web,site,extension,api,extractor,expo}`. Nx project names carry the
scope — `@stxapps/bracemark-web`, never the folder name `bracemark-web`.

`bracemark-web` (the app, `app.bracemark.com`) and `bracemark-site` (the public
marketing site, the apex `bracemark.com`) are **different properties**, not two
words for one — write "the marketing site" on first mention. See
`docs/architecture.md`, _apps_.

Layering, lowest first: `shared → crypto → react → ui → app`, crossed with a
platform axis (`agnostic` / `web` / `worker` / `expo`) where a platform may use
`agnostic` but never another platform. Hence the sibling pairs —
`web-crypto`/`expo-crypto`, `web-react`/`expo-react` — and **packages must never
import an app.** Both axes are declared as `nx.tags` in each `package.json` and
enforced by `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`, so an illegal import fails
`npm run lint` rather than failing silently. Per-project tags, per-package
responsibilities, and the reasoning: `docs/architecture.md`.

# Package manager

- This monorepo uses **npm** (npm/npx), not pnpm or yarn. The lockfile is `package-lock.json`.
- Run Nx via `npx nx <target>` or `npm exec nx <target>` (the generic Nx guidance above shows a `pnpm` example — ignore that here).
- Use the root scripts where they exist: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm run reset`.
- **Whole workspace vs. one project.** The root scripts above fan out to every project (`nx run-many`). To run a target on a single app/package after a change, scope it by the project's full Nx name: `npx nx <target> <project>`, e.g. `npx nx typecheck @stxapps/bracemark-web`, `npx nx test @stxapps/bracemark-api`, `npx nx build @stxapps/bracemark-web` (`npx nx show projects` lists them). To check only what a change affected across the graph, use `npx nx affected -t <target>`.
- **After making changes, autofix before checking.** Run the fixer first so `lint`/`typecheck` only report what needs real attention: whole-workspace `npm run fix` (ESLint `--fix` + prettier), or scoped `npx nx lint @stxapps/<project> --fix` for a single project. Then run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` (or their scoped forms).

# Docs

`docs/` is the design record — read the relevant file **before** changing code in
its area, and update it in the same change when the design moves. Each is
self-contained and cross-links its neighbours.

# Tripwires

Rules whose violation is **silent** — no lint error, no type error, no failing
test. Check the linked doc before acting on any of these.

- **Dependency versions on the Expo side.** Root `package.json` pins the
  version; `bracemark-expo` declares `*`; packages declare a peer `*` (a real floor
  only where it means something). Never declare `expo-modules-core` anywhere;
  never write `*` in the **root** manifest (it resolves to `latest` — SDK 57, not
  54); pin `react` exactly, no caret, and follow any bump with `npm dedupe`. A
  second opinion on one of these versions nests a duplicate copy, and the symptom
  is an opaque native crash, not a version error. → `architecture.md`,
  _dependency versions_. Related: `nx lint --fix` will re-add an
  imported-but-undeclared dep to a `package.json`, so read its diff.
- **`apps/bracemark-expo/ios/` and `android/` are generated and gitignored.** Every
  native change belongs in `app.config.ts` or a config plugin. A hand-edit in
  Xcode leaves a _clean_ working tree and is destroyed by the next
  `expo prebuild --clean`. → `expo-build.md`
- **Greenfield — no migrations.** There is no production data. Edit persisted
  schemas in place (Dexie `version(1)`, the expo-sqlite DDL); don't add a
  migration step.
- **Extensionless imports inside packages.** `from './lib/theme'`, never
  `'./lib/theme.js'` — packages are `bundler=none` and consumed as raw source, so
  the NodeNext spelling resolves literally and 404s in Turbopack/Metro.
  → `architecture.md`, _module resolution in packages_.
- **Never write "extension" bare.** Two unrelated things carry the name: the
  **browser extension** (`bracemark-extension`) and the iOS **share extension** (a
  target inside `bracemark-expo`). Qualify which one on first mention, in code
  comments and prose alike. → `architecture.md`, _apps_.
